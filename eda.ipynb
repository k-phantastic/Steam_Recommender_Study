You can sometimes beat a monster in 2-3 moves, and matches are over almost as soon as they begin. Chances are you won\\'t even need to use any spells or items. Then suddenly, things get challenging. I wasn\\'t able to defeat some dumb old ant in a cave, and then I realized I really started having to strategize more overall. The fun really begins then.\\n2) \"It\\'s a freemium game ported into a regular one.\" - Yep, guilty as charged. Lots of unnecessary elements present to \"keep you playing\", and equipment falls apart very quickly, but...it hasn\\'t been a game-breaker for me.\\n3) \"It\\'s too expensive!\" - Yes, wait for it to go on sale; I think there are other, better match-3 adventures to partake in if you\\'re paying more than $10.\\nAll that said, it scratches that Puzzle Quest itch when I need it (though I\\'d recommend Hell Girls, Puzzle Kingdoms and a few others first).

Oh boy, we have lost contact with Zibylon - one of the most resourceful planets we’ve colonized in space. We need to do something somewhere in Zibylon, and the only option I can think of is to send one of our drones to Zibylon to check it out!\\nSomewhere on Zibylon is a third person (drone actually) / exploration / puzzle game where you take control of a smallish drone with the goal of recapturing all the stations and mines on the planet.\\nThe game has several phases of play. The first one is the planet control, and this is where you’ll start the game. In a nutshell, you’ll see a rather dark planet and you’ll be able to fly your drone, which is equipped with a light underneath. As you fly around the sphere, orange balls will appear. These balls will represent good places to mine which you can easily do with your drones. After collecting resources, you can go back to the main base (where you started) and craft new equipment (such as weapons), upgrade your hull and a few other options. You can also dismantle objects to extract important components which you cannot dig out of the ground at this point. I must admit I was stuck there for a while. My small tip for you is to gather a lots of debris to dismantle. You’ll need to recapture mines and stations that will lead you to the next phase of the game; the puzzles. Another quick point . . . the enemies will have lasers, canons and also rockets placed around Zibylon, so make sure to equip your drone with weapons and hull upgrades in order to defeat them.\\nIn the puzzle phase, you’ll control another drone which you see on the third person view. Your goal is to figure out the puzzles and find the exit doors to clear the stage. There are around a dozen levels to clear; at the time of writing this review, I am about half way through the game. The puzzles are pretty much environmental puzzles. Your drone enters a room and you have to figure out what does what, and where to put or push objects or mechanisms to get to the exit door. You’ll also have to be careful of enemy drones, and let me tell you, if they get you in their radar, you’ll be gone in a flash! Then you’ll have to restart the level, or on some occasions at a saved point, depending on the size of the stage you are in. Make sure to look everywhere as you might say to yourself on more than one occasion, “What am I supposed to do?”  Every detail needs to be looked at, which can be frustrating at times. Your drone can pick up square boxes, too, and you can use them to lure enemy drones to different locations, but if there are any, you’ll have to use stealth to go around them. Oh I nearly forgot, make sure to turn off the light!\\nGraphically the game could have been a bit more polished, but it looks ok. In terms of the controls, they works well. I really enjoy the combination of phases of play; it’s refreshing, especially if you get stuck somewhere in a puzzle for a while. I must say that some of the English translations could have been better.\\nPositives:\\n~~~~~~~~\\n-\\tChallenging puzzles\\n-\\tMining resources, craft items and upgrades to your drone\\n-\\tAchievements and trading cards\\nNegatives:\\n~~~~~~~~\\n-\\tNeeds to be a bit more polished\\n-\\tSome of the translation to English could be better\\nI really enjoyed Somewhere on Zibylon, with its challenging puzzles, exploration, mining resources and craft items.\\n7/10\\n\\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

       "  'text': 'Overall I find Shadows of Adam to be a great little RPG, which is very newbie friendly as well, but it could use a bit of polish.\\nThe writing and humor could use some work, and I wish it turned more serious a bit earlier than it did, but it works just fine.\\nIt has no random encounters. Instead it uses fixed static encounters (that respawn if you leave an area) that block the way forward and some of the treasure chests. It\\'s a little bit on the easy side in my opinion, with the exception of one boss fight that apparently glitched on my side causing it to be a lot harder than it was supposed to be. One of the best combat features is that it actually requires the use of skills/spells instead of being simply \"mash attack until I win\".\\nPlotwise it isn\\'t a masterpiece, going with a \"My dad shows up as a ghostly figure looking for help and we have to save him!\" with some \"There was a war 100 years ago and now we need to fix the thing that happened due to it.\" thrown in for good measure. As the game overall feels more aimed towards newer players (at least in my opinion) it\\'s definitely not a bad plot as far as that goes. The pacing works really well too, it never bogs down too much with unnecessary dialogue or forced \"side\" activities.\\nI did however run into a few bugs and glitches.I\\'ll list the below, but do know that I have sent bug reports and videos to the developers who are looking into what caused them and they generally seem to have a good idea on how to fix most of them.\\n- One boss glitched so that it did up to 8 attacks per turn instead of the 2 attacks per turn it\\'s supposed to do, making it quite difficulty to beat.\\n- One of my characters (Kellan) died at the end of a battle and ended up with negative HP which apparently made him immune to resurrection spells and items forcing me to reload the game.\\n- Spoilers for the end of the game where I had one final glitch:\\nAs I mentioned at the very start of the review it\\'s a pretty great game, but could use some polish. But it\\'s definitely not a bad way to spend 8-12 hours, especially not if you\\'re just starting your RPG journey.',\n",

Fortunate for me though there were no achievement guides or walkthroughs for it as the demo is it's own game & not a section of the base game. Because of this I had to solve all the puzzles myself. Not being able to check the internet every time I got stuck & I've got to say I had a lot of fun with this one!\\nSome of the fetch said item from across the map & bring to said location challenges/achievements were a little tedious. But apart from that controls worked well. At no point in the game did I find myself getting frustrated because my character wasn't responding correctly. The puzzles are challenging without being overly hard. And the game doesn't demand you get all Gold in Time Trials if you don't want too. Bronze is only required for a 100% & the Gold times are only there if Time Trials are your thing & YOU want to do them.\\nNice open levels, a money & upgrade system, new gadgets every level, interesting puzzles & enemies to keep you on your toes. Give the demo a try not just because it is free but because it's fun as well!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Witchinour is a difficult twin-stick-spellcaster roguelike, cutely-ugly with chunky pixels and a bit-filled soundtrack. Others have already mentioned Nuclear Throne and Risk of Rain, of which elements of both are present – Witchinour essentially affixes a ROR-styled Time/Difficulty system to the NT overhead shooter thing. It’s a move providing initiative to keep the pace up, play quickly and dangerously – especially once bosses get involved and no cover exists, and your evasive maneuvering will be seriously put to the test. Death comes quickly in this game, often from a single mistake.\\nCombat-wise, it does take a bit of getting used to the spells & specials available, especially with a relative lack of information available. Different spells and specials unlock with play so you do get a chance to gradually try everything out, but you probably won’t be winning any runs until you've picked a single character & spell set and stuck with it for hours. At this point I’m finding it difficult to want to branch out beyond the Sniper character with Protection & Overcharge spells, but that’s also because I think it’s the fastest build.\\nLevels are randomly generated and, for the most part, this works. On occasion, you’ll be dropped in the middle of a mostly-open level surrounded by enemies & projectiles from all directions, and, well, in most cases, dead. Spells and specials tend to be instantaneous, lasting for a second or two at most, and the upgrades can seem a bit muted. There is a thrill to surviving this kind of thing, but it can also be deflating to finally reach a high level and be wiped out in an instant. To this effect, I wouldn’t mind seeing more of an effect from the level-up upgrades, which might potentially help balance out some of the difficulty/character imbalances.\\nMy main criticism is that the bosses can seem unbalanced and occasionally unfair, certainly at least until one has fought them enough times. In addition, some of the earlier levels seem to appear more frequently than others, which can make learning boss and enemy patterns somewhat challenging – and that’s assuming once you finally get to the boss, it doesn’t decide to repeat the wrong attack multiple times in a row, depleting your MP and/or HP stocks in a second. As of this review I have beaten the game a few times and, while very satisfying, it does occasionally feel like luck factors in on some boss fights. Stages 4 & 5 (Lab and Battlemage) are especially punishing in this regard; without any cover, the machine-gun spam of wall-reflecting bullets fills the screen nearly instantly, and even with the extra invincibility frames powerup it’ll chew through a full HP bar in a second. As for the earlier stages, the Dragoon and Orc levels seem noticeably more difficult than the Archery and Ruins stages – I am unsure if the level selection is random or tied to your Alert level, but the difference in difficulty between these levels seems rather marked.\\nI would like to give an appreciative nod to the soundtrack, as I’m especially fond of how it subtly integrates itself while dialing in the intensity with the progression of levels. Each level starts off with a relatively minimal theme before a new layer of music is added with the progression of each floor – it’s a nice touch, deceptively cute on the earlier levels but with some filthily intense distorted bits as the game gets harder.\\nI like Witchinour quite a bit, but I’m a glutton for this kind of punishment. The difficulty will undoubtedly ward off some, though much like Nuclear Throne, as you get faster and more confident in dealing with enemies, the waves of “this is impossible” gradually subside. In any case, definitely one for the “I want my games difficult” set – there may be “fuller” games of this type, but the minimalism here cuts away any loose fat and leaves what matters: fun, fast-paced action that’s certainly worth the five dollars if you don’t mind getting slapped around a bit.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Very, very good game. I love dungeon crawlers, roguelikes and light bullet hells (like Enter The Gungeon, or even a bit TBOI, even if I wouldn\\'t call that \"bullet hell\"), and believe me: I\\'m super picky with games. Like SUPERpicky. I browsed Steam games for DAYS (not kidding) in search of some great roguelikes/lites dungeon crawlers, and Witchinour is absolutely one of the bestest I could find!\\nBelieve me, I have 126 games in library, I know how a good game looks like!\\nLet\\'s make the ol\\' good pros/cons list.\\nPros:\\n- Surprisingly pleasing graphic. I like simple, retro pixelart, but that one is just capable of creating a great atmosphere. Again, I was in art since 2009, I know how good art choices look like, even when minimalist like in this case.\\n- Challenging without being exaggerate or frustrating (haven\\'t finished the game yet)\\n- Well structured, pretty content (items, outfits...)\\n- Well structured, higly recognizable enemies (that\\'s something incredibly important in this kind of game)\\n- Pretty, immersive maps\\n- Immersive soundtracks (during the levels the same soundtrack \"evolves\", I liked it a lot)\\n- Very simple but not bland or ripetitive. This is the kind of game you play 100+ hours\\n- One guy said he didn\\'t like the monitor-lines effect. Dev made them optional. That\\'s a good guy.\\nCons:\\n- Dam! I love these little cute maps, but I can\\'t read their names! The order in which you find the levels is partially randomized, making you find one type of level or another for the second level, for example. I love it but everytime I try to read the level name, it disappears. \"Oh look, it\\'s the Dragon ...\" it disappear. I\\'d love the level names to stay for a couple of seconds to read \\'em, because I\\'m really interested in these little details, they make the game even more immersive!\\nConclusions: don\\'t wait for the game to be in sale, for two reasons:\\n1 The game is worth 5€, word of honor.\\n2 The dev needs and DESERVE your support, if you like this kind of games. We should stop letting talent to die.\\nBuy Witchinour and have fun. 10/10 recommended.',\n",

It\\'s somehow more \"minimalistic\" but in a really good way. If you ever wanted to play a game which is similar to Nuclear Throne or other dungeon crawling shooters - Witchinour is the right game for you (with increased difficulty and some nice twists) ...and it\\'s cheap.\\nAlso it has cute 8-bit graphics and you\\'re able to disable the scanlines if you don\\'t like them.\\nSome cons:\\n- you can\\'t play Witchinour in windowd mode (right now/ the option to change from fullscreen to windowd mode has to be implemented)\\n- it\\'s not yet playable on Windows 10 without compatibility mode (because Windows 10 sucks haha)\\nI\\'d like if Witchinour gets \"bigger\" in the future with more witches, spells, areas & mobs and (of course) mod support :p',\n",

       "  'text': \"You play the game in 3rd person view as a small metal repair drone with 360 degree camera control & movement. Signals have been disrupted with the bases on our planet Zibylon, & you are sent to sort out the severed connections to the mechanical equipment on a dozen bases (+1 control Center 0) so you can restore power to the planet’s operations. First, you have to take each base back from the alien drones that have taken them.\\nThe only thing that was missing was aliens.... at least in the bio form. There seemed to be no biological life on Zibylon... just us drones. These indie space flicks often give that new world feel like when you opened your first comic book as a kid.\\n\\nThe puzzles are actually embedded within the framework of the mining mini-game & combat. You craft, upgrade, & fight to take over the bases on the planet. In each base are mechanical/ geometrical puzzles to solve. Puzzles build on previous puzzles.\\nSomewhere on Zibylon is not a Space Cowboy/ Interplanetary Merchant game like Asteroid Bounty Hunter. The only real economy is the elements you mine. You are a lone space drone. To give an idea of where the game fits in with others in the space genre, since SOZ is such a unique game:\\n-Puzzles comparable to Portal or The Turing Test in difficulty\\n-The stealth reminds me a lot of the stealth puzzles in Stealth Inc, 2\\n-Exploration & Mechanics like in Opus: The Day We Found Earth\\n-Minimalistic Strategy similar to Rymdkapsel\\n-Mining is somewhere between Planet Driller and Empyrion, with Planet Driller being extremely simple & rather dull, and Empyrion being a complex & deeply satisfying space mining sim.\\nBut, what makes SOZ unique is the complete lack of hand-holding throughout the game. You are given a strategic user interface between the planet view and the hangar. Within the crafting and Outfitting, you are allowed to think for yourself and explore your options, much in the way of Paradox games. This is in contrast to the Civilization series where you have a turn by turn framework and are guided through. The crafting, outfitting, and solving the puzzles all require you to think and plan in much the same way as when you are using a diagram to assemble a new bike, or build something.\\nNo edges have obvious highlighting, arrows, or other artificial directing devices. It looks realistic like irl.\\nThe puzzles stations are varied, and can be captured out of order, though they increase in difficulty. The combat has a light-weight depth to it. You are given good control & a variety of weapons & parts to fight with, but the combat is not really what I would consider complex. You are either prepared with enough armor & firepower or you lose the fight. Puzzles include warp speed devices, lasers, & myriads of gravity defying spheres, particles, tubes, & generators.\\nI enjoyed the mechanical feel. I'm not sure if it would have the same effect without the spectral music & fx. A depth to the atmosphere created by addition of fog, subtraction of light. The ambient soundtrack is lovely. I really enjoyed the music in the game.\\n*Combat is an exciting part of the game, much-needed break from the puzzles.\\n*A variety of lasers, turrets, and stealth are employed.\\n*Puzzles are challenging & require you to look for details, follow wiring paths, evade lasers, use stealth.\\n*You can dismantle the debris to extract more valuable resources, such as plutonium spheres, needed to craft weapons.\\n*You are able to go on recon without installed weapons or combat hull to preserve valuable resources.\\n*Time in game is adequate – I have 16 hours in online play, as well as another 8 or so off-line hours.\\n*Quite Linear story line. I solved Level 4, before 3 & 5 to unlock Plasmatron build parts, then didn’t have the research unlocked to build until I completed 3 anyways, for example.\\n*Some elements are minimalist, as with the mining there is no depletion of materials in the “mines.” You can mine the same 2 spots back & forth all day long (any 2 spots on the planet yield the same elements mostly.)\\n*No real depth to the damage taken. You do have a numerical value to your hull strength. You do buy better hulls & amplifiers to compensate.\\n*Needs hotkeys for mine buttons etc. rather than mousing the buttons.\\n*Collision/ Clipping produces some pretty awesome geometrical configurations. I’m not sure this could be avoided with the 360 degree nature of camera controls you are given to operate the drone, and the constraint of the tight spaces you find yourself in. It does not seem to hamper the presentation of the game though.\\n*Not as polished as a top tier game. Some sentence construction seems slightly atypical for native English speakers. The Blender favicon appears on the launch tab instead of the game favicon. Those are the only 2 nitpicky things that really stuck out in my mind.\\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game, for an honest review from Good Games Giveaways & Reviews. I only accept games I feel I can give a positive review. Since SOZ is definitely my genre of game, I jumped at the offer of the one key available. The game far exceeded my expectations.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Let\\'s start with a very important statement: Shadows of Adam is a recreation of jRPGs from the 90\\'s. It\\'s not a simple love letter and it\\'s definitely not filled with lazy references to older games. It stands on its own and it\\'s clear that the developers put a lot of effort in understanding how the classic jRPGs were made, what was their structure, tone and topics. I\\'m not sure if it was the goal, but the story itself very uses a lot of ideas described in \"The Hero With A Thousand Faces\", what only highlights the fact that there\\'s a lot of good, old but tested and working ideas.\\nThe writing is both the greatest quality and the main problem of this game. The story is overall great, characters have interesting personalities and the dialogues aren\\'t boring, even though they\\'re not fascinating. At first I was weary that the game will be focused on chasing some boring element-related macguffins, like many of the older games, but the writer smoothly used it as a disguise for some interesting and creative ideas.\\nHowever, similar to games such as Final Fantasy VI (III in USA), the comedy put in the game doesn\\'t work that well. There\\'s a ton of bad puns, childish squabbles between two of the main characters and a lot of moments that don\\'t feel natural in the game\\'s rhythm. Too often it feels as if the game is looking for comic reliefs, even though it never really needs them and sometimes has a great pieces of comedy writing in it. I don\\'t understand why did we need so many childish, even clownish characters. I don\\'t mind making one of the main villains a complete goofball and I don\\'t want to say that the comedy in the game was inexcusable, just pushed a bit too much.\\nAlso, I hate how the characters keep having dialogue lines as \"...\" / \"(name)...\" / \"I guess...\" and so on. God damn it stop. Please stop.\\nWriting aside, the game has quite interesting battles though I wish there would be an automatic victory option, like in \"Ara Fell\", since some of them are a bit repetitive - as turn-based battles tend to be. Sound effects are great and graphics, including battle animations, are beautiful, but the majority of the music, even though loops well, is forgettable and deserves an improvement. Some parts of the game introduce puzzle elements, but the camera makes it difficult to predict where the character can actually walk through. Many times I was surprised that a large corridor was blocked because it was \"in the middle\" of two tiles, while in other times the character was walking at tiny edges like a ballerina.\\nOverall, a great game. Not without problems, but they stay in the shadows and some of them may be completely unrelatable to you. If you don\\'t like retro-jRPGs, this one won\\'t really change your mind, but if you wish they could be available in their former glory on your Steam, this one is a great option.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Edit: Having a good laptop for gaming now, I\\'ve been able to play this. Recourse is a quite heavy game, even though I could run this on a laptop with a dual-core processor although cooling issues (or that I suspect) kept me from progressing; I\\'ve thought of testing if I could find a certain bottleneck like, I dunno, RAM or the integrated GPU or something else, something tangible that I could see and identify as a possible cause for the problem, but since I don\\'t use the old craptop anymore, I haven\\'t had the exact chance for that.\\nDisclaimer: I\\'m writing this review partly with the full version in mind, so my experiences with it influence this review, e.g. when I compare the demo and the full game.\\nAnyways, Recourse as a game is very great; it\\'s one of my favourites so far. For the keyboard + mouse configuration, controls are smooth and working. I also like that players are able to switch between 1st person and 3rd person views as they like, so those who prefer either can choose and not be bound to whatever the developers have chosen.\\nWhen it comes to the story, it\\'s mostly covered by the conversations between Sleet, who\\'s your player character, and Floe as you progress through levels, but it works since it not only gives you information on what has happened, but also builds up what kind of characters Sleet and Floe are. The demo\\'s story starts rather differently from that of full version\\'s but the setting is same: you find yourself from an unknown place and proceed to find out where you are and why. Like it\\'s said in the description, this demo is a standalone game, and in my experience it\\'s the perfect way to see how well Recourse runs on your machine and at which settings; there is a fair amount graphic settings to adjust. The demo also lets you get inside what kind of a game Recourse is, allowing the player to see if they like it, so I recommend anyone who\\'s interested in the game to try it out. It\\'s free, after all, and also small in size so it won\\'t take up that much space. The developer\\'s Youtube channel also has videos on Recourse, I recommend to check them out too.\\nIn the gameplay, there are three different kinds of stages: Puzzle stages, Wave Rush stages and Payload stages. Puzzle stages, as can be suspected from the name, are progressed by solving puzzles with a variety of mechanics, and I have enjoyed them; they are not too difficult to repel beginners, I never found them too easy to bore me, especially since certain opened doors etc. remain open after finishing the stage and thus don\\'t force the player to redo them when returning to the stage later. Later on in the game and especially when looking for question marks and achievements such as easter eggs they do challenge as the player learns to use what they have.\\nWave Rush levels are about fighting enemies known as failbots and gather failbot drives to open up doors in the stage and exchange for waves that can be used for upgrades for Floe. Just like Puzzle levels and Payload levels, these levels also have question marks to be found to use for upgrades.\\nIn Payload levels, you escort a wagon through its route while erasing obstacles from its way and beating failbots, thus earning failbot chips that need to be deposited into the wagon before the time runs out and the wagon closes up for the rest of the stage - more time can be acquired on the stage, so there is space for exploring the stage to find question marks and exploring. Any chips deposited into the wagon are carried out of the level to be used for upgrades.\\nTL;DR: I haven\\'t tried out co-op nor controllers, so those are for other players to tell. However, for what I\\'ve experienced, I have nothing to complain about the except that it requires quite a quite powerful computer to play it with a decent FPS on high settings. The story is interesting and well executed, gameplay is smooth and movement free, and the game looks great and pleasant, plus the colors are colorblind-friendly. In addition to that all, the game doesn\\'t take much space and is thus fast to download. The demo is perfect for testing the game before choosing to buy it. :)\\nPros:\\n-Nice idea\\n-Works well\\n-The colors are pleasant and nothing hurts my eyes + colorblind-friendliness\\n-Nice puzzles that make the player use their brains\\n-Intriguing story that is executed well via the conversations\\n-The main characters are very good\\n-Smooth controls\\n-Small file size\\n-A lot to see and find\\n-In my own experience the developers have been active and helpful on Steam\\'s discussions on Recourse\\n-The possibility to switch between 1st person and 3rd person views\\nCons:\\n-It\\'s a heavy game for the hardware\\nOld text: \"I haven\\'t played this much, not even to the end of the first level, because my laptop\\'s cooling sucks and can\\'t handle this for even 10 minutes without the whole laptop heating up so badly that it starts to lag at 3 to 5 FPS. Seriously, I\\'m perfectly fine with 10 to 18 FPS I usually have with medium settings (I could get it to something like 20 FPS when I lowered the resolution), but when the voice starts lagging too, it\\'s the end of playing, no can do. Just as the requirement of Quad-Core processor may suggest, this is a very heavy game (but I can easily run this on my dual-core processor *lol* the only problem is the crappy cooling and it\\'s troubling everywhere). Anyhow, I do like this a lot, this is a great game.\"',\n",

I am not an in-depth expert of WW2 battles but I think all divisions which participated are there like numerous SS Panzer Divisions or American Airborne Divisions. Whenever a new day starts you will receive a briefing with detailed information like supply situation, arty range and, for example, summaries of what happened in the actual battle of the bulge that specific day. You will read about little european towns like malmedy and the divisions involved, what happened there and then see it on your battle map which is pretty cool and immersive!\\nTo talk about the game itself, BotB does NOT have a persistent campaign but many little scenarios which is probably something most people need to know considering that games like Panzer Corps or Order of Battle do have them!\\nGame mechanics or its rules are a bit hard to get used to like when you move an infantry division without moving the tank division which is also on the same tile. Your tank division won't be able to move for the entire day which made me a tad angry the first few times or when the RnG is simply not in your favor.. However, considering that it was all about time and speed in the battle of the bulge I started to dig some of the more 'unusual' rules after a while..\\nIt is not unfair, though! Even when I lost my first attempt on the 'Reach the River Meuse' mission with the germans, the second time I won even with way more unsatisfactory dice rolls. The AI suddenly started to panic once it realized that my entire arsenal of tanks was popping up in the center and apparently didn't know if my plan was to go to bastogne or to the meuse so it kinda tried to defend both which allowed me to reach the northern tile adjacent to the meuse..\\nSo yea, keep in mind that this is not a triple A experience for 9.99$. It's a sexy little strategy game for WW2 buffs ; )\",\n",

But, I need more polish. The controls, regardless of peripheral of choice, are not precise enough and the give and take of combat is not enjoyable.

The wearying combat, the shoehorned dialogue, and the downright tedium of collecting crashed upon me like a wave and I closed the game.\\nPerhaps with a bit of work the menus and inventory might be less laborious, a more streamlined methodology of sorting, building, placing, upgrading would go a long way toward removing my hesitation at progressing. Characters that don\\'t very mysteriously know everything and throw blatant old jokes in blatant old ways might engross me enough to over look the flaws.\\nI think this game would benefit from overhauling the combat and maybe changing the perspective to a tighter third person or even a first person and switching the system of teleporting between \"islands\" or \"worlds\" or \"crumbs\" or whatever and make it a nice large open-ish world that could really show of the speed of some of the goliaths.

And, well, it definitely IS Sudoku stretched out across a globe but that\\'s really all it is and the new viewing angle doesn\\'t serve any purpose but to make it harder to read the board. It doesn\\'t change the game to be anything but a sloppier version of this already well established thing. The abundance of hand holding also becomes rather annoying, as though it\\'s great for those new to Sudoku there\\'s no way to disable it as far as I could find, and it basically becomes this catch all safety net where you can just try combinations until they turn gold and lock in place signally that you got it right.\\nThere\\'s a story (of course there\\'s a story, why wouldn\\'t there be in a Sudoku game?) but I\\'m pretty sure I\\'d have a more enjoyable time reading over the Clue instructions a couple dozen times than listening to these odd, clay-like mannequins reciting tired murder mystery cliches and making banal small talk. When the best part of your game is that one of your character seems to be wearing a wig made of Cheetos then you\\'ve pretty much left me at rock bottom trying to cling to anything that\\'s even remotely amusing.\\nI used to think that it was pretty impossible to screw up a Sudoku game. Sudoku is such a well understood - thing - that there\\'s not really much more for you to do but make the pen and paper logic puzzle digital. But Sudokuball is that first time for everything. It\\'s presentation is unnecessarily tedious to decipher, low resolution, allows no space for writing down potential numbers, and forces you to use some obnoxious Sudoku training wheels. It managed to make me kind of hate Sudoku, a game I\\'ve loved for years but in this form left me reaching desperately for my coffee table book or any of the dozens and dozens of better video game adaptions.

You control the two \"things\" with two joysticks, but I can\\'t remember any part that took extremely precise angles or coordination so wasd/arrow keys are likely adequate.  There are two other buttons necessary (shoulder buttons on controller), so thumbs/pinkies would be needed too on keyboard.  Definitely recommend controller if at all possible, but you can always try it out and refund it if the controls are annoying.\\nI feel like the difficulty curve of this game was pretty solid, which is always difficult in a puzzle game.  There is one mechanic that is used here and there and I felt like those levels tended to be easier than the rest, but it wasn\\'t a huge problem.  I think this game is easier than many other puzzle games, but only in the sense that it doesn\\'t suddenly throw an absolutely BS level of difficulty at you at some point without working your way up to it.  There\\'s a nice progression of new stuff to think about without hitting a hard wall.\\nThe puzzles make you think in a fun and pretty unique way.  You can think of each half of the screen as two sheets of paper that you would layer on top of each other.  The bottom left corner of the blue half is also the bottom left corner of the orange half, and so on.  This, combined with the usable items and obstacles, made for a good assortment of mechanics to explore.  At 4 hours-ish of gameplay, it explores those mechanics well without overstaying its welcome.\\nI was sent a key for this back when it first released, and didn\\'t play it for months because the trailer didn\\'t really wow me and there have been many other games I\\'m excited about.  I feel silly for waiting this long to play it, though.\\nAfterthought edit:  I guess I should have mentioned the game\\'s story, since *technically* it has one.  You can probably guess my opinion of it from the fact that I didn\\'t even remember to mention it, though.  The story amounts to probably one page of wordless comic panels.  I probably wouldn\\'t have even bothered with it if I were the one making the game, but I don\\'t think it really detracts from the game in any way.  Each time you finish a set of levels, you\\'ll unlock a couple panels of the comic.  But yeah, pretty forgettable.',\n",

Good God, Shadows of Adam is the very best ‘retro inspired rpg’ I have played. There, I said it.\\nI scrapped and rewrote this review several times. I almost binned it altogether. I’m a real connoisseur of nostalgia fuelled retro stylised video games and Shadows stumped me.\\nI enjoyed my adventures in the SoA so much that it became almost impossible for me to critique it in a fair and proper way. How do you accurately and fairly critique the best retro inspired RPG you've ever played without just dribbling and flapping all over the bloody place!?\\nTo call SoA short but sweet would be a massive understatement. The story and way that you progress through the game world is so perfectly paced! This is not a 200 hour RPG, it’s just long enough to reel you in but there's absolutely no grind, it never gets tedious. Which is impressive because if you go back and play a few of the Golden era RPGs that we all remember so fondly, you'll likely find yourself getting bored or frustrated by some of the dated game design aspects. The characters and their personalities are intriguing and interesting. The game has plenty of slap stick humour that helps to build your connection to the characters.\\nI’ve always loved random battles in RPGs, but some games get them so wrong.  In SoA you’ll find encounters scattered throughout the game world, it really feels like each battle has been meticulously placed so as not to create a grindy experience. The boss fights are interesting and fresh, you can beat each boss with some careful planning and strategy, rather than just grinding up your stats and whomping through each boss. The way that you can stack damage and deliver massive blows using buffs and de-buffs is really fun.\\nYou cannot buy a retro inspired RPG that has this level of quality and polish because it doesn’t exists. Grab Shadows now and fall in love with your childhood all over again. Awesome.\\nPlease check out and follow my Steam Curator where I shine a light on the very best indie games and occasionally poke fun at some of the worst.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"It takes something unique in a puzzle game for it to attract my attention.  Usually I overlook them when they present themselves like so many others as something that uses the same tired mechanics of other games and puzzles and adds the 'twist' of being extra difficult or painted purple.  When I saw the simple but fairly unique design of Semispheres, I had to try it out.\\nI don't know if I've ever had a moment of 'reading a book by its cover' being met with such accuracy, but Semipheres delivered exactly what it presented in its trailer and screenshots.  The control scheme was intuitive at first, but the puzzles soon had my brain splitting in half and struggling to get my hands to respond the way I wanted them to.  What makes this game so different is that you so often see the solution to the puzzle well before you can really execute it properly.  Even with my limited experience in puzzle games, I recognized this feeling from the Portal series, where often you'd discover what actions you need to take but had to contend with precise execution before you were successful.  The most difficult and ultimately most memorable puzzles in Semispheres were those that had you relying on precision timing and accurate movement of your orbs simultaneously.  Succeeding here was very rewarding.\\nSemispheres really delivers some quality design in mechanics and puzzles along with relaxing visuals and music.  The bit of story tied in doesn't hurt as well.  Only a couple issues really stood out.  The main one is that when I did finish it, it reset without any sort of confirmation.  Sometimes a player wants to go back and do specific puzzles or maybe even check out the story portions again.  It seems like it would be easy to change that from an automatic event to one that has to be triggered in the menu.  The other thing that some might find frustrating is the length.  It only took me a little over two hours to complete it and I'm not exactly the best puzzle solver on the planet.   Yet even then that could draw comparisons between this and the original Portal given it averaged a three hour play time.  I personally found two hours to be quite good given the ramp up in difficulty that is present.\\nYou probably won't see too many puzzle game recommendations from me, but Semispheres is definitely one of them.  Especially for fans of the puzzle genre.  They may not find a $10 investment too great for two hours of gameplay (or less if you're really good), but for novices like myself, the $5 discounted price I paid was well worth it.  I can only hope that the developers have found enough success to move forward with the title or at least the mechanics and give us a sequel or similar game in the future.\\nIf you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here:\\nCheck out the video review here:\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I backed this game on Kickstarter and am very happy with it, if for no other reason than it actually got done and it's fun.  It's very much a love letter to older console-style RPGs, especially certain Final Fantasy games.  At times it feels like it goes a bit beyond 'homage' into 'derivative', but the aesthetic and gameplay really make up for it.  The sprites look great and the world has a great look and feel.  Combat is fast with the right level of balance; trash mobs aren't very annoying while bosses can wreck you if you're not careful.  The way skills are handled in combat is great - basing everything on percentages of the AP bar instead of fussing with discrete MP values makes things flow much more easily, and everyone having ways to recharge AP means there's no need to ration it while exploring dungeons.  The puzzles interspered in the dungeons are tough without being ridiculous, and quite solvable without needing to hunt down a guide or checking the message boards.  I haven't tried the DLC yet - I grabbed it because I want to replay the game but the base game doesn't really have replay value.  I'm looking forward to trying a New Game +, and hitting all the achievements.\\nIf you like these kinds of RPGs, you'll like this game.  Based on what I saw during the Kickstarter and now on the message boards, the devs seem very involved and responsive.  I'm looking forward to whatever their next game is, and hoping they improve on what's weak, build on what's great, and come out with another fun game.\",\n",

Well I just remember myself visiting a port-town of Adam. During exploration the following thoughts came into my mind: \"If this would be an old SNES-RPG there would be a hidden entrance to that house when I move the character right behind it...\" Let\\'s try that for nostalgic reasons. A few moments later the screen turned black and when there was light again a dusty chest stands right in front of me. That left a big smile on my face - really satisfying. :)\\nThe game also provides many other great features:\\n* Enemies mostly follow a well thought strategy\\n* some very well hidden Treasure chests which require you to observe nearly EVERY single wall of the entire game\\n* Boss battles could turn very hard if you don\\'t level up frequently\\n* some interesting puzzles (e.g. water labyrinth with levers, floating orb puzzles)\\n* interesting story (unfortunately a bit short) / characters with background-information\\nLast but not least: There\\'s still new content!\\nIf you liked games like Lufia or Mystic Quest Legend I\\'m sure you\\'ll enjoy this one too...',\n",

Too many odd decisions, very poor pacing and combat, which you do mainly in the game, is terrible. Did any of the developers playtest their game?

More could have been done with this.\\nAnd then it hit me. How can you get a simple click and drag control system so wrong? The only possible explanation is that this game was never designed to use a mouse as an input device. The evidence starts to mount up and now I feel like an actual detective. The resolution options, of course! This game was never built for PC. It was built for a smartphone, that's why the cutscenes use still images and have no voice acting.\\nIt all becomes clear.

Great, now we can talk about the game itself.\\nWilliam H. Stanton, aka you, find yourself face to face with an old childhood friend Edgar, who seems very scared and gives you an item to take care of and keep away from him under any circumstances. Right after him, a doctor barges in to tell you that Edgar has gone mad and needs to report to him for a medical care. And of course, being the great friend he is, Willy goes on the quest of saving his friend from whatever madness he descended into.\\nBecause the game is based on the works of H.P. Lovecraft, I was excited to play this game expecting an interesting and intriguing story. While the game does have it's moments where the story seems to be heading in the right direction, more often than not, it just makes no sense and is all over the place. One thing that I didn't like in the way storyline progresses is that you are always expected to do one thing and one thing only to keep the story going and until you do that you can't move on; it is very linear in the way of what you need to do. The puzzles are very difficult to understand and to solve some of them I had to look up a FAQ because I was lost.\\nThe graphics are not very good, but considering this is a 15 year old game, that's not unusual. The voice acting is actually really good, but there are no subtitles, which can be a problem because some of the characters talk weird and you may not be able to understand them at times. The sounds of the game and the background music do a really good job of creating a suspense and eerie atmosphere throughout the game which is always a plus.\\nI haven't encountered any bugs, apart from the one already mentioned in the link above, so at least that is not broken (too much).

I love how each 'boss fight' had a different theme, adding a lot of variety to the game. There were even a few points of the game where I was a bit creeped out (thanks Scarecrow!) so it has a bit of something for everyone.\\nI also liked the Riddler Challenges a lot. If I ever had a moment where I didn't feel like beating up bad guys, I could take a small break and explore the island looking for question marks and solving riddles. As someone who doesn't have a thorough knowledge of many of the baddies of Batman, I really enjoyed finding the Riddler's question marks and finding out more about different characters.\",\n",

Felt to be like a cross between FFIV and Lufia II. Some things I particularly appreciated:\\n- being able to save anywhere eliminated a lot of the tedium that sometimes comes with rpgs\\n- no random battles, no need to grind\\n- being able to experiment with the grand rel. by removing socketed items meant that you didn't have to wait to the end game to start using these powerful items\\n- the puzzles were hard and satisfying\\n- most of the skills were useful throughout the game\\n- the game wasn't in general self-indulgent, and little self-indulgences, like inserting at least two (three?) of the developers into the game as irresponsible soldiers, weren't apparent until later and then made me smile rather than cringe\\n- the length of the game was great. Long enough to have depth, but didn't drag on\\nAdditionally, the developers are very responsive and friendly on the forums and clearly care about users' experiences. The game seems to a lot of potential for hacking/modding and I'd be surprised if some interesting user-generated content doesn't appear in the future. I'd like to see an enhanced difficulty mod or extensions to the battle arena.\",\n",

Your drone, which you use for the puzzle aspect of the game, moves quite slowly and level 3 is a LARGE level.

The whole game has a little bit of that 'Planet Driller' vibe; very indie but well done.\\nI am, however, deciding to refund it as I think the price point is a little high for what Zibylon has to offer.

Enjoy.\\nThis was a game with a fair deal of potential, ruined by two major factors:\\n1. Developers being out of touch with the direction of their game. When you bill your game as being the arena shooter of hero shooters, people expect certain things out of the game design and balance. So when you then nerf the fast and furious features, in effect attempting to balance your game like you're an 800 pound gorrilla named Blizzard, you shouldn't be surprised when you hemmorage your core audience. In other words, they claimed to be selling us Mahvel, and then attempted to deliver Slow Fighter 4.\\n2. Nexon being Nexon. Nexon is your stereotypical asian shovelware producer personified. This is a company that puts out public statements towards their players that sound like corporate boardroom chatter, because they don't even know to hide the massive degree of seperation between them and the people buying their products. This company is run by a bunch of out of touch suits who give not a single crap about the various products being produced under them. As a result, Lawbreakers is just a bunch of numbers on a balance sheet to them, and so you can expect them to be ineffectual at best, and an absolute wrench in the gears at worst.\\nIf somehow this gets to some suit at the top of Nexon, I have only this to say: I have no interest in PUBG, but this game did briefly get my attention when I gave it a shot during the open beta. Entering a crowded market may make finding an audience difficult, but it alone wont kill your game.\\nA better, more cohesive and perhaps more unique delivery of the game's vision, as well as it's business model, could have allowed Lawbreakers to cut out a little slice of the market all to itself.\",\n",

I read the reviews here and decided to chance it... I am not disapointed AT ALL with my purchase. I am a huge fan of Baldurs Gate, only discovering it about 3 years ago, as well as a few other RPGs that have been re-released to those of us who were not fortunate to have PCs at a young age and the LARGE step above consol gamming they provide. If by any chance you are in a similar position and you find complex CRPGs fascinating, then please do yourself a favor and purchase this Trilogy. I bought them on sale of course, but have had more fun with \"Blade of Destiny Classic\" than I would with the newest and more polished Elder Scrolls entry. This game is unforgiving, to me in the Best way, and I confess that I haven\\'t even finnished the first quest....Its that hard to me, but like I said I am a Noob. However, despite my humbling experience with micromanaging and Character Building, the hours spent with the heavy shadow of failure hovering above have easily been some of the most entertaining I have had with an RPG. Yes, I\\'ve played Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Final Fantasy, Dragon Age, and Mass Effect, but I seriously have never been as emersed into a game as I have this one. It is difficult to learn for a simple minded guy like myself to fully grasp, but I honestly feel rewarded with every effort I put in.\\nNOTE: I know you don\\'t want to hear this.......I can\\'t beleive I did it myself... READ THE MANUAL. It comes with the game here on Steam (Just right click the title in your Steam library.) You WILL get the best Experience if you will take the time to READ it, not glance over it. If it helps it is easily the most entertaining manual I have ever read, granted I have read very few. I am too dumb. LOL.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Very good game. What I like is the simplicity. You can play this game immediately and have a good game with the AI wrapped up in 30-60 minutes. The real enjoyment is verus other players and PBM. It is a cross of chess and a traditional board wargame. The game is well balanced and both sides will be on offense and defense for roughly half the game. You do need to know the nuances of the rules but they are not overly complex. I hate when I play games that are about say Operation Barbarosa and you have to get down to the detail of how many tires need to be ordered for your motorized units...if you take my meaning. This game does not have that detail. Your big issues will be guessing the enemy's next move, concentrating your forces for offensive action and sometimes trying to withdraw from sticky situations. Offense and defense both take skill and preplanning. This is because once your forces are committed and engaged it gets hard to unengage and redirect. I feel this is historically accurate.\\nMy only mild dislike is the combat system which often produces insane results on the extremes. A small single point unit holds off an entire Panzer Corps or Armored Corps. While smaller units can delay they could never stop such an attack especially for a day or two. However, the luck tends to average out and it is not usually completely determinative. Things absolutely will go wrong or against you at times but I feel that is accurate, too within a certain range. Combat never ever goes like your initial plan, at least not for long.\\nI give this game a top rating as for me it is the best kind of game to play. Virtually 100% of your time is spent on moving and playing and not game management. You will stare at the map considering your next move carefully as the sequence of your moves is as important as the tactical plan itself, much like chess.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'When I first caught word of Shadows of Adam, I admit I was skeptical. However, my opinion changed as I followed Something Classic’s twitter, and got further news on SOA.  When I got ahold of Something Classic, for a streamer’s review copy,  they were more than happy to allow someone to review the game on stream.  I was pleasantly surprised when I booted up Shadows of Adam, in spite of the issues I had getting it to run on stream. The game could not be streamed right out of the box with game capture, until we found out you have to set compatibility mode to windows 8, and run with a window capture. My ps4 controller also refused to work, unless I ran the game from its install folder, and not from steam.\\nThe following is a breakdown of each game element, and my personal opinion. Though I recieved the game for free, it plays no bearing on how I will review it.\\nGraphics:  When playing this game on stream, I had to constantly hold back my enthusiasm for how great Shadows of Adam looked.  It brought back feelings of plugging the cartridge in, and waiting for my CRT to give that distinctive hum as it turned on.  Character attacks have a certain flair to them, look pretty to use, and feel powerful, especially the magical attacks of Asrael. The team at Something Classic poured their soul into the sprite work and it shows. Area maps drip with atmosphere, colors pop, and I found myself just admiring everything as I played.\\nSound: Tyler Mire’s sound design invokes a certain feeling, the melodies that play with each battle, character, scene, and story twist invoke that snes style.  I did find some issues with looping within the first two towns. However this is not enough to detract from the overall feel of the soundtrack.\\nGameplay: Instead of having random battles, Something Classic opted for on screen enemies. However not all of them can be skipped, especially when you are searching for hidden loot. This removes the need for grinding and in turn provides you with a learn as you go experience. Each battle will be tougher than the last, causing you to use your newly learned skills. Within the battle system itself is the encouragement to use your most powerful abilities whenever you want.  As AP recharges over time, and with skills such as Taunt/Focus/Meditate. There is no need to save everything for one big boss battle. There is also a degree of tactics needed for the battles in managing your AP properly for high damage output.  Some fights seem to produce bugs within enemy AI. I once had a foe who was frozen, and could not move due to a status ailment, but their partner was able to blur them. Giving me a target that could not be hit or taunted again due to already being taunted.  There is a massive difficulty spike when you reach a certain area. Where the monsters instant death attacks seem to hit quite often. Which caused me a couple of resets.\\nIn the Guild of the Artificers DLC a special accessory combination system is added. Which allows for outrageous combinations of 3 other accessories.  Allowing the player to “break” the game by giving absurd abilities. Such as  never missing attacks, attacking two times in a row, and always criting with hits. It is up to the player’s imagination to discover their own style with these special combinations.\\nStory: Without spoiling anything, Shadows of Adam spins a wondrous tale. The story is not complex, but it does have a couple of twists. You will expect the twists, however they will come in a form that you will not expect.  By only having four playable characters the game laser focuses its story on them, their interactions, and how the world flows around them. Each character has a story you want to learn more about.  However, the game is woefully short. About 10-15 hours if you focus on story alone.  I would like to see more, there is so much about the game world that I want to know, and feel.\\nSummary: Shadows of Adam is a wonderful throwback to the SNES genre, that takes its own spin on the system and runs with it. The story, characters, graphics, and gameplay, while sprinkled with a few bugs is top notch. I found myself wanting to play more. This game sent me back to my childhood of eating sugary cereals and playing videogames on a saturday morning. A time where I fell into a story and found myself a part of the game’s world.  This game is a must have for anyone looking to get that feeling again.\\nThank you to Something Classic, for making a wonderful game. I look forward to your future projects and hope for your success.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Hi all,\\nLet me say a little something about Shadow of Adam:\\nThis lovely game really deserves to get more attention and people who like to play and purchase old school feel, retro snes type games. It's a basic old school rts that's not telling a compellingly deep story, but it's still good to follow through nonetheless. The graphics i personally think are very well done and really add to that classic feeling from the past. The game is not that lengthy (9-12h) depending on your playstyle it could be a bit more, but the developers are including new dlcs as we speak (Oct. 2nd 2017) which will add to the overall enjoyability and length of the game including new features and whatnot.\\nThe sound/music is overall enjoyable too, but please also note it's similar to those scores and sounds from way back in the snes/Super Nintendo days.. So they've basically kept it all as real as possible which to me just adds to the whole as a retro game should be in the end. (But i know it will not fancy everyone who isn't yet as old als me) ^_^\\nTo conclude, it's a very enjoyable game guys but keep in mind that this game offers nothing spectacular, however what if does offer works very well together as a whole and it's very stable on whatever system you like running it on.\\nThe developers are all very nice and responsive to feedback and offer help as soon as they can, which is always a really nice way to support the future projects for this developing team.\\nThere's still more to say about this game obviously, but i'm not a man of many hints or spoilers so i can only advice others to check out the game (it's also offering regular discounts etc) and it's not expensive to get at all considering what you get in return.\\nGive it a try guys, and thumbs up if you like it and if not well refund it for something else (Steam).\\nCheers!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Goliath is a crafting action rpg game that has lots of potential that hasnt been used by the dev. Despite all of its flaws, this game is still fun regardless. You are newbie pilot who are going for a test fly(drive) of your newly built plane, something goes wrong, your plane crash and you wake up on a remote strange place. Its your job to find a way to go back to Earth. You can create giant robots which called Goliath to do 90% of your things. Without the Goliath, you're going to die in less than 5 seconds against an enemy or two, cause they can kill you in 2-3 hits, some can one hit you.\\nPros:\\n- Crafting system, is similar like crafting anywhere, but you get quite lots of things to craft, from weapons, healing items, materials, buildings and goliaths.\\n- Every shards (thats what the world in Goliath called) has its own biome and creatures in it, there are 4 biomes, wood/forest, swamp, desert and snow/ice.\\n- Goliath, your best friend and your armor. You can ride them or switch them to auto pilot, but riding them is the best option, cause the AI is not the best. If you encounter enemies while auto piloting, your goliath will got rekt pretty quick. Just ride them. There are 4 types of goliath, wood, iron, stone and crystal. Each has its own skill sets, atributes and effects. And to add complexity, each type of Goliath has its own variants (think of it as armor), example, wood goliath has coal armor, snipe armor, pirate armor, etc. And each of them has its own effects, pretty nice. You can equip melee and range weapons for each of your goliath. You can store them if you are not using them or deconstruct them to get some materials. To unlock a certain goliath variants, you have to complete the experiments associated with it on the Experiment tab.\\n- Factions, there are 3 factions in Goliath, Fox, Forgers and the Robots (sorry I dont remember the third one). By improving your faction points in certain faction, you can trade with them and help them solve quests. Sadly, there is nothing more than this.\\n- Crystals, this is one the important resources, you use this to teleport to another shards and to upgrade your equipments later in the game when you have recruited certain NPC\\n- As I mentioned above, you can recruit 5 NPC to work with you in the  game, they have a purpose, such as a material trader and a beastmaster (to see monsters you have killed), weapon trader, heal your goliath, upgrade your equipments, bringing you random materials in a certain period of time.\\n- Combat is ok, each goliath can only equip weapons made from the materials associated with them, example, wood goliath can only equip wooden weapons, stone goliath with stone weapons, etc. And the main character you ask? Nah, the main character Gromov is like a pudding, soft, weak and tasty, he cant equip or even upgrade his initial revolver. Stick to your goliath.\\nCons:\\n- Story is meh.\\n- Lack of enemies variation\\n- The worlds are pretty much copy paste\\n- Why I cant upgrade or equip Gromov with equip?? Its frustrating when my goliath got destroyed and I am out of warp stone in the middle of the map, and has to travel far to get back to my base, the revolver can suck bull's♥♥♥♥♥♥ it takes 7-9 hit to kill the chicken enemy (or dodo, i dont care). Gromov only has 1 active skill, invisibility. This is a potential you can use.\\n- Combat is lack of guard button, its funny that a goliath so big cant block.\\n- Lack of storage, I had tons of weapons on my storage which is unused because of lack of inventory slots, and I can only bring 6 weapons at a time. And I only has 3 chests to store my things, I thought I could craft more chests, oh boy I was wrong.\\n- Add Sprint button for the goliath. The goliath walks a little bit slowUse the crystal goliath to travel around, the crystal one can warp, before you get the crystal one, the iron one is okay.\\nPick this whenever you like sale or no sale, imo, its worth the price.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I am genuinely baffled by my conflicting feelings over this \"Lovecraftian\" adventure game. Okay,\\nis nothing miraculous. It\\'s old, it\\'s clunky, full of bugs with irritable animations... yet still manages to set an eerie enough atmosphere to drive your perception skills to its limits. For that account only, it is not possible to recommend this game to anyone. Even if one is to set aside the fact that the game is raddled with bugs, it would still be an acquired taste forced down your throat.\\nIt\\'s year 1927 in rickety village of Pawtuxet, Rhode Island. A silent afternoon is abruptly interrupted for young William Stanton by his friend, Edgar Wycherley. Edgar seems off, panicked and fearful. He entrusts William an odd pyramid shaped relic and asks for him to protect it, even from Edgar himself at all costs. Then, Edgar takes off as oddly as he appeared before William\\'s door. Minutes later, Doctor Egleton, Wycherley\\'s family doctor visits William to inform that Edgar hasn\\'t been himself lately, consumed by his studies of archeology and asks William to inform him immediately if Edgar is to be contacted. After these strange visits, William decides to visit Edgar himself and learn more about these \"studies\" of Edgar\\'s in hopes of aiding his friend. That\\'s how young and avid William Stanton gets himself into an interplanar mess centering a quite specific book of occult: Necronomicon.\\nSo far, so good. The story is interesting to begin with, weaved with mummies, strange disappearances, long deceased ancestors, sigils and summoning of spirits. Yet is the presentation of the story fulfilling and satisfying as the game progresses? That, I\\'d like to vote as abstaining. There is a great amount of lore thrown around for us to monitor and take note, but they are not processed as elegantly as possible in my opinion. Anecdotes keep coming to us without any time for us to digest any kind of on-goings. On that part, it is bad construction for a story revelation.\\nThe game hailing from 2001, graphics are nothing extraordinary, a bit clucky and plastic even for character models. Aside oddly shaped characters, the basic environment presents a creepy yet dull atmosphere suitable for any gothic setting, yet it doesn\\'t actually deliver the Lovecraftian elegance that one would be waiting. Voice acting is neat, with accents of the original time period, but without the option of a subtitle, and much information for you to pursue hidden in cinematic dialogues - without an option to record spoken information in game - ends up being a complete obstacle for progression. You have to play this game with pen and paper + earphones if you\\'d like to make something out of the story.\\nWe are already used to the linear gameplay for an adventure game, but\\ntakes this part a bit more seriously than it should. One of the main problems for this game, if you ask me, is that you are expected to complete one solemn action at a time, and unless you discover and accomplish that specific action, nothing progresses. You are allowed to explore on your own; it just won\\'t do any good. That\\'s why everything turns into an \"action hunt\" on a wide map for you to figure out quickly.\\nPuzzles are another issue altogether. They are quite obscure even with the collectible information, asking you to run through a series of spiritual and occult references - most of them are authentic, by the way: kudos on that part - to figure out your next step. They are never easy and demand that you take notes in every step of your game. I\\'d love that if the lore that we use for puzzles would be at least somewhat relevant to the plotline that we are pursuing... It is mostly not. Oh, and remember \"Old Ones\" concept that we were so excited about, because, I don\\'t know, this is a LOVECRAFTIAN game? It really doesn\\'t deliver at all.\\nCombined with a series of common bugs that would make the game impossible to finish without an exe. copy of an old retail cd - it is possible to reach one in the guide section of community -\\nends up being a lame adventure game with some cool references thrown around. If you are a fan of Lovecraftian literature, sure, you can try. But even then, I\\'d doubt that you\\'d enjoy it much. I tried so hard to like this game but even as a Lovecraft fan myself, I sadly did not.\\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller\\'s Curator page\\n- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!',\n",

Not.\\nVery little guidance, no clues.\\nThe puzzles, as other reviewers have mentioned are tedious. It's not that they require more attention or cleverness than other games, it is simply a matter of having to attempt everything that you can possibly attempt in order to advance to the next one. That is infuriatingly difficult because every scene looks identical to the next, every character has the same graphics, every voice has the same terrible voice actor. You'll retrace your steps many times, and eventually give up. This is not a game, it's a piece of software intended to induce anger.\\nGo ahead, find this review unhelpful. In what way am I not helping you understand that this game is utterly awful? Do not buy it. Don't even finish reading this review, just run away.\\nIf it's true that Steam are preventing the developer from making updates that is terrible.

You have to think fast to put the obstacles/bridges on time so that Bob reaches his destination safely. The mechanics are very well thought, although overall I feel the game was not super challenging, and there is not so much diversity in the puzzles.\\nFor a little game like this, the design is nice and cute. Bob's dreams give you a nice sensation of peace mixed with surrealistic elements.\\nIt took me only 4 hours to unlock all achievements. I think Back to Bed would have benefited a lot from a level editor, unfortunately there is none.\\nBack to Bed is a nice puzzle game for casual gamers.

       "  'text': \"Shadows of Adam brings back the old SNES era JRPG style with many inspirations that shows clearly both in its presentation and gameplay.\\nFor example, one hour into the game and you will make parallels between this game and Mystic Quest, Lufia II, Secret of the Stars and many other. Along with a turn-based battle system using an AP system where you recover some AP every turn and unique skills for every character that can synergize quite well with one another, the animation quality is quite top notch and surprisingly pleasant.\\nThe soundtrack, which is available as a separate download, sounds very retro with a few memorable themes. At times however, there seems to be a disrepancy between the styles used as some themes will definitively feel like an attempt to reproduce MIDI chips while other themes will be much more orchestrated in style. As for overall sound design, battles definitively feel much more impactful than expected, with hits and skills being satisfactingly deep and crisp.\\nThe story is entertaining yet not something that will blow away expectations. However, it has enough original ideas to make you continue on your quest. Some characters are quite interesting and funny while one in particular is a dead giveaway for a well known antagonist from another JRPG. Regardless, the heroes themselves have interesting personalities that, unlike most recent JRPGs, aren't too outlandish or exagerated; for the genre, the heroes feel grounded and believable instead of face-palmingly annoying.\\nThe pacing is controlled in dungeon by the use of puzzles that uses specific mechanics. Some of these puzzles will leave you pondering on the solution for quite some time (and for that, let me advise you : the solution is usually far less complex than you expect) which lengthens the experience. All in all, I believe a good hour to an hour and a half might've been of puzzle solving. And the final dungeon gave a twist with one of the puzzles that I really didn't expect.\\nGear progression is linear in that most towns will give you progressively better gear while dungeons will have a few unique pieces hidden behind more difficult puzzles. Given the gear is divived only between Weapon, Armor and Accessory, I was pleased that seeking the harder to find items often gave a serious boon to your characters.\\nOverall, the experience is very nice for the price tag and the game can run for around 12 to 14 hours, depending on your puzzle deduction skills and willingness to search for secrets and endgame quests for the truly powerful equipment.\\nIf you're looking for a little throwback to the early SNES era JRPGs and want something that feels polished as you play it, then this title definitively deserves to be given a try.\\nIt definitively makes me look forward to the next game this developer will create.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"A fun, short (my total playtime was 12 hours, and I missed a few secrets) RPG that brings to mind late NES and early SNES era games, especially Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest. The best thing about it by far is the combat system, which uses a %-based system where each skill consumes a set amount, and you regenerate a set amount at the beginning of each combat round. The game has no random encounters, which is pleasant, with enemies appearing stationary and generally just blocking your path.\\nThe downside is that the game's dialogue, characters, and story are pretty forgettable, and what drove me to keep playing was learning new abilities, finding new gear, and coming up with new strategies to fight the enemies. The combat system is definitely the game's strong point -- I ended up not really caring about the characters or their motivations. The graphics are reasonably well-done with only some minor silliness here and there (like a wide space that looks like you could walk through being impassable, or blatant arrows showing where you can jump down instead of a subtler, more natural-looking hint).\\nMy other complaints are minor and come down to personal preference. Each character only has three equipment slots: a weapon, an armour, and an accessory, which is a bit lacking compared to some RPGs. Additionally, aside from choosing an accessory (and some optional endgame gear), there's no real customization for characters in terms of skills or stats. They always level up the same way and learn the same skills at the same levels. This is fine for a relatively simple game like this, but if you're looking for extensive character cutomization, you won't find it here. Lastly, some of the enemies in optional lategame dungeons are very frustrating to deal with -- not a major strike against the game, just a personal gripe.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Overall: Okay adventure puzzle game with some nice extras.\\nThere are basically two sides to this game - you can run through the point and click story interspersed with 60 puzzles of varying types (some puzzles are quite similar to each other, but nothing gets overused too much). The story isn\\'t anything special, and the humour which plays a lot on the stereotypes of various fairytale characters didn\\'t really work for me, but it didn\\'t really detract or annoy me either. The running about between screens clicking on everything to try and ensure you unlock all the puzzles before ending the chapter was a little annoying, but there aren\\'t too many characters/places so again not a show stopper.\\nThe bonus for me was the 6 extra puzzle modes that you can play to earn hints for the story mode, which are nicely set up and reasonably broad - so for example you have a symbol matching puzzle where you have to match the symbol that appears in the centre of the screen with the other copy of it that appears amid a bunch of decoy symbols, and you have about 3 seconds to click the right one. The key here is it automatically balances the difficult of each of the puzzles - as you do better you get more decoys, more complex symbols, and the decoys become more similar to the target.\\nThe other 5 are different types of endless puzzle:\\n- Picking out a shape out of several others that describes itself incorrectly - so it might say \"yellow square\" but actually be red (occasionally the rules reverse to have to pick out the correct shape with most descriptions being wrong),\\n- A \"Simon Says\" pattern repeating puzzle, which gets more fun when you have to enter the sequence backwards\\n- reading an analogue clock face as it gets rotated, loses most of the digits, and finally gets flipped as if you are reading it via a mirror\\n- A dual puzzle where you have to count the number of each colour of coin and enter them, but also up to three independent timers appear as well with a number on them - after you estimate that many seconds has expired since each timer appeared you click it (while trying not to distract your count of the coins)\\n-A puzzle I suck at where it tells you peoples names, and the object associated with them. Once it has finished the list it then either shows you the object and asks you to type in the matching name, or tells you the name and shows you 10 objects for you to pick which was associated to them\\nThis obviously gives it a lot of replayability that the story part of the game doesn\\'t have, and the fairly widely scaling automatic difficulty levels these extra puzzles have built in should make it suitable for a quite wide range of abilities.',\n",

       "  'text': \"If you take a brief glance at a video for this you may think it's all about timing and dexterity but it's nothing of the sort. This is a puzzler through and through.\\nYou have two rooms: orange on the left, blue on the right, with a jellyfish in each. The two rooms are usually identical, sometimes there is a small difference. Using your left and right controller sticks, you have to move both of your jellyfish to the exit portals at the opposite ends of the rooms. Doorways are guarded by sentinels with vision arcs, and if one of your jellyfish gets caught by an arc he's zapped back to his starting position.\\nPlaced at strategic points around the rooms are powerups. Each jellyfish can collect one at a time and use them to solve the puzzle. In the vast majority of levels the powerups are used to help the opposite jellyfish, so you mostly only need to control one at a time to complete the puzzle in sections.\\nThe most prominent powerup opens a circular portal to the other side, so a common solution is to place a portal in an area where there's a sentinel nearby on the opposite site, then go and collect a 'summoning bell' powerup and use it to call the sentinel away, allowing the other jellyfish to sneak past. Other powerups include switching one (or both) jellyfish to the opposite side; transporting sentinels to the other side; setting quick-transport lines to convenient locations in the other room.\\nThere are a small number of levels where you have to use a bit of dexterity to move both jellyfish swiftly and simultaneously to get past sentinels before they return, but generally you can play at your own pace and deal with one jellyfish at a time. It doesn't require the reflexes of a housefly by any means.\\nLevel overview is rather nice, you move your 2 jellyfish to the portal to start a level in the same way as you would within the level. There are 13 sections each with a random number of levels between 3-5. As you complete a section you're rewarded with a wordless comic strip panel depicting the story of a boy and his robot. It seems rather pointless but why not, I guess. There is one glaring issue with this game: each time you complete a level it is LOCKED and you can't go back to replay it. Bizarre. The dev says he had no idea that people would want to replay levels. Erm, OK...\\nThe game is currently Windows only, but there is Linux in the offing once the dev has worked out some bugs with it. Steam Cloud, trading cards and achievements included.\\nAlthough there are comparatively few graphical elements, it's tasteful and stylish. There's a blue/orange theme throughout which helps your brain connect with the puzzle system. The whole thing shimmers like a desert heatwave - no, my video isn't fuzzy, that's how it actually looks.\\nMusic is more of a background ambiance with no melody and the sound effects are the usual thing, it's all pretty standard stuff for this type of game.\\nThere are a few downright easy levels, even in the later stages, but generally I'd say medium difficulty. Levels will keep you thinking for a few minutes but not much longer than that. It's a casual, relaxing game with no danger of rage-quit.\\nIt's a good quality game and you won't be disappointed, but with 50-60 levels, many of which don't take long to solve, this is a rather short game for the price. The final achievement is called 35:00 which means you can speedrun the entire game in 35 minutes, and this is the only replay value you'll get out of it. I would wait for a 50% sale.\\nIt's a pleasant, satisfying game with an interesting and unusual concept. It's fun while it lasts, but this is not one you'll be adding to your favourites. You'll play it once, enjoy it, then move on and forget about it.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'This is a hard game to recommend to some people. I actually liked the animation, though it is admittedly clunky. I also enjoyed the music plus I am a huge fan of Lovecraft and anything (well almost anything) based on his writing. That said this game has some very cool \\'Lovecraft\" moments and is based upon the story \"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward\". The game play  issues with the game are the problems towards the end where you cannot get an important piece from an alchemist set you find earlier in the game; it is EXTREMELY frustrating. Also it is point and click game with short cut aways. However with that said, I think people are being too hard on the game. If you have no experience in reading Lovecraft this probably is not the game for you. It is not especially violent or typical of most games that are popular right now, slow and lots of reading/puzzles but with a very well done creepy feel. It doesn\\'t have super flashy graphics as only a few people actually designed and made it. But I still enjoyed it and was quite happy once the bug with the case was ammeliorated by using the link provided above in another review. All that said, if you\\'re not a hard core Lovecraft fan you might not like it. 8/10',\n",

       "  'text': 'This puzzle game revolves around building a maze to get your sleepwalking friend bob into bed. You ... are a dog? The story is weird but it keeps the general theme of \"keep Bob safe\" so everything you do and all the weird stuff you encounter sort of make sense. There\\'s some fun imagery to delve into if you have the time.\\nThe actual maze building gameplay is more action oriented than actual puzzle solving. In terms of the puzzles it\\'s mostly \"Put down thing to make Bob not move there.\" Fairly simple, but the game adds difficulty by varying the platforms Bob has to walk through and limiting the number of objects you can use to move Bob. Usually you can\\'t just place all the objects down and let Bob walk the maze on his own, you don\\'t have the resources.\\nThere\\'s a lot of running around and it\\'s a lot more active then the puzzle gameS i\\'ve played recently. Most puzzles i\\'ve played recently (like hexcells) are very slow and require you to stop and fully understand the area you\\'re working with. Instead the game focuses on having you use a few objects multiple times to solve a puzzle. Put an object down, wait for Bob to interact with the object, pick the object up and run to move it to the next spot Bob will need to interact with it before Bob gets there. This sort of design allows the player to sort of learn the level as they run through it and figure things out on the fly, which is really fun. It reminds me a bit of late-game portal puzzles where you had to jump into a portal and while inside the portal you shoot a second portal, changing the direction you\\'ll come out from. Still requires the player to understand the level, but you don\\'t have to figure out everything immediately and a lot of the solving comes in the middle of doing the puzzle, rather than at the start.\\nThe don\\'t have a lot of problems with the game. I\\'d like a reason to revisit old levels. Maybe include a death counter or a timer? Also keyboard controls exist, but feel clunky and just using the mouse for everything is way easier. Pausing is not mapped to a button, you have to use the mouse to hit a button on the top right of the screen. Sometimes the Geometry\\'s perspective will mislead you; that\\'s really frusterating and its definately intentional. Lastly, it\\'s not as hard as the sit-still-and-solve puzzles (but it would be a lot more frusterating if it was).\\nAnyways it\\'s engaging and very fun.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Realms of Arkania is a complex RPG. It comes with a steep learning curve and daunting complexity which scares away probably all but the most dedicated RPGers. It\\'s based on the \"Das schwarze Auge\" pen & pencil system which was / is a strong competitor of D&D in Germany. If you hate number-crunching, rolling 10 minutes to get just your first character as you want him to be or shy away of reading and understanding the manual throughly before you start, you might want to skip this. Try Drakensang instead, a newer title with the same system, but with the rulesystem hidden in the background of the game.\\nYou\\'re still reading? This means you might have found a gem that will grow to your heart...\\nRoA uses a unusual character system where you don\\'t just get 7 positive stats (strength, dexterity, wisdom etc.), but also 7 negative stats (superstition, claustrophobia, curiosity, acrophobia, avarice, necrophobia, violent temper), all with direct effects on gameplay. It\\'s just one of the factors which makes the game more intriguing.\\nThese games are also noted for their realism. This includes the partys hunger and thirst, as well as the effects of weather and terrain on movement. It\\'s probably the most accurate CRPG ever in terms of adventurers health problems. Your characters will become sick if they aren\\'t dressed properly for the climate they pass through. They will get sick if they sleep on the ground. They will get sick if they get wet. They will get sick if they don\\'t get enough sleep. They will get sick if attacked by undead. Their wounds will get infected if they don\\'t stop and take care of them after each combat.\\nRealms of Arkania games are as much RPG as you can get. It\\'s not your standard run of the mill action-RPG, it\\'s RPG pure. There\\'s a reason why they\\'ve gotten published by Sir Tech, who are responsible for the Wizardry games. They require patience and commitment, much like all great games of its kind. But it rewards you with that special experience, that keeps lingering in the back of your head years after you played it.',\n",

It is enjoyable to fight enemies, and get big combos, but quite easy as well. Towards the end of the game, you can fight 16 men in a room at once and doing it is very easy. Bosses are generally quite easy, apart from Killer Croc and Poison Ivy (Which are later in the game). The final boss fight was an absolute joke though; way too easy and repetitive beyond belief. Aside the tremendously boring final boss, this game was very enjoyable to play and I completed it in around 7 hours.\\nNOTE:\\nI would strongly advise playing this game with a controller.

Even the achievements are really just tacked on to it just because.  No real trick to them but checking out the various languages and finishing it.  Finishing it, with achievements, and writing this review, took a little over an hour.\\nThis is not a game, it is not trying to be a game, it is not pretending to be a game.  I do not even count this as a virtual novel, since most VN's have choices you can make (altho it's a novel, and it's virtual...).  This is probably the closest Steam has ever come to being Nook or Kindle.\\nThis is a charming, decently done anime-girl-esque adaptation of a timeless classic.  Seriously, I'm pretty sure most major characters who could be turned into anime girls were... XD.\\nIt is decently done, and I enjoy the music.  Since this is a classic novel, the music is classical.  No rock, no rap, not even swing, jazz, or blues!  Pure symphonic.  Simplistic symphonic, not like super dynamic Pirates-Johnny Depp music.  Calming.  Only a few instruments at most at a time.\\nDespite the anime girls that all the characters seem to be transformed into, this might be a nice way to introdure your kids to Alice in Wonderland, if you can't get them interested in the book... this is pretty faithful to the original, much closer than any movies or games that I've seen *cough* Disney's, American McGee's, Madness Returns, etc... *cough*\\nIf you're unsure about this, try to get it in a bundle or on sale!\\nImo, this is worth it at $5, but I got it in a bundle, myself, and just had to dl and try it...  =^_^=\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Heyo folks, End World Gaming here to share an excerpt from my review for Battle Chef Brigade by Trinket Studios and Adult Swim Games.\\nBattle Chef Brigade is an Iron Chef inspired cooking game that combines an RPG, Visual Novel and a Match 3 game. It’s a unique combination and it’s impressive how well each of the mechanics work together.\\nThe story begins with you playing as a Battle Chef Brigade hopeful named Mina Han. She works in her family’s restaurant but she thirsts to learn more in the ways of cooking. So, she decides to run away from home to join the Battle Chef Brigade tournament in the hopes of being accepted into their ranks. To win, she must challenge other chefs to cooking battles Iron Chef style.\\nTo win a chef battle, you must incorporate the required ingredient in the meal as well as include the Judge’s favorite magic element. Doing so will net you bonus points and make your meal that much more enjoyable to each judge. The game starts off easy with only one judge to please but as you progress you’ll eventually need to make 3 different meals for each judge. You must do this within the time limit as well.\\nTo get ingredients for your various meals, you need to fight monsters using the game’s side scrolling beat ‘em up style combat system. The combat system feels very fluid and you can chain together combos easily. There’s a wide range of unique monsters for you to face during a battle and they each drop unique items to cook with.\\nThere are a wide range of different cooking tools and sauces that you can utilize during a cooking battle as well. Sauces allow you to change the type of cooking gems you have in your food. Cooking tools include specialized pans, a slow cooker and frying pans to name only a few of them. These tools must be purchased from the shop in town.\\nTo obtain money for the shop, you’ll need to take part in various part time jobs which act as mini-games in between battles. It’s highly recommended that you complete the part time jobs because they unlock new features in the game. There are 3 jobs to take part in. The first has you solving puzzles in order to unlock new cooking features, with the ultimate goal of acquiring ambrosia, the ultimate sauce. The second is based on the hunting of monsters and will allow you to acquire new combat abilities. And the third is a line cook job which has you cooking meals as quickly as possible.\\nTo cook meals the game utilizes a match 3 style setup. The objective is to match 3 same colored cooking gems to create a more powerful version. This can be done twice until you have the best gem. The higher the level of the gem the more flavor you’ll get out of it. So, if you want to flavor it with fire, having level 3 flavor gems throughout will flavor it with fire. If you have a specialized cooking pot you can move your dish to that and you’ll be able to combine the specialized element with only 2 gems instead of 3. The slow cooker will also cook gems into higher level over time so it’s a good idea to use it when you head out to gather more cooking ingredients.\\nOverall, Battle Chef Brigade is an incredibly well put together game. From it’s well written and voiced story to its fun combat system and addicting cooking mechanics, the game has quickly become a favorite of mine. The game is a highly addictive experience and the cooking battles were pretty intense. Especially when you don’t know if you’re going to come out the victor or not. If you have any love for Iron Chef or even cooking themed games, then I highly recommend this game, it’s superb in every category.\\nIf you're interest in checking out my full review or would simply like to see my final score, you can find the review here:\\nThanks a lot for taking the time to read the review folks and happy gaming!\",\n",

Even better are the predator sections, which precisely recreate the sequence in any good Batman film where he eliminates a group of thugs one by one, striking invisibly from the shadows.\\nThere are a few flaws, of course, one or two disappointing boss fights and an underwhelming conclusion.  But they are only small things that should not stop you trying this out.  Recommended for any fan of action games or Batman.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"is a kinetic visual novel that retells Lewis Carroll's\\n.  I'm sure that quite a lot of people know this story, as it has been adapted into many forms of entertainment, most notably, into movies.  This kinetic novel does not change the original story in any way.  (I checked this to be sure.)  Thus, it tells Caroll's original story but in visual novel format with art, music, and a few sound effects included.\\nSince I'd be completely giving away spoilers by doing a story synopsis, I'm going to skip it for this review.  Instead, I'll just go straight ahead and give my opinion.  Personally, I love these old, classic stories so I was interested to try this KN out and see how faithful it was to the original story.  I'm glad it stayed true, as I tend to be wary when there are changes made to a classic story.  The art was beautiful, especially the background art.  The sprites were well done, too, although with the female sprites, they would tend to lean towards being more anime sexy, which I'm not sure if that was appropriate for this kind of story.  The music was nice as well, as many pieces were beautiful classical music and I happen to love this music genre.  You can play this novel in quite a few languages so for those whom English isn't their native language, they could choose among Chinese, French, etc.  I thought that this was nice of the developer to make that option available.  Also, the Steam achievements were very easy to get, as this is a kinetic novel, so this will be a huge plus for those looking for easy achievements.  However, what I liked about\\nwas the story itself, getting to sit back and enjoy reading and immersing myself in it.\\nOverall, I highly enjoyed this KN and I'd recommend it for those who are into VNs or even just want a good story to enjoy.  Now is it worth its asking price?  I think it might be debateable.  I do feel that this is a good KN but the price may be slightly high for the amount of content in it.  Thus, I would say that if you aren't sure whether to get this for yourself, then wait for a sale and buy it then.  Still, it's worth getting and enjoying, especially for the story.  ^^\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Decent little jRPG style game worth about 9-10 hours on a first run through and more DLC content coming to inflate that. Graphics inspired by the likes of Lufia and Final Fantasy 5, it has a great classic style to it. The main party are all fairly well fleshed out, getting several backstory flashbacks over the course of the game letting you know who these people are and their motivation for following their quest. The battle system is simple but has enough complexity that it isn't just button mashing. It's certainly a great attempt by an indie developer and delivered on a lot of promises by its kickstarter campaign to deliver a classic style RPG.\\nIt isn't perfect though. The story is a little too simple. It isn't quite 'save the princess from the dragon' and as I said, the main characters are well fleshed out, but side characters are pretty much just stereotypes dropped in to move the plot along and the antagonist is a little too derivative of Final Fantasy 6's Kefka without much of the charm and comes off very two dimensional. What is developed of the setting is good, but several elements are mentioned or teased but never expanded on, particularly at points it would have made sense to (that I won't get into due to spoilers). The game is also very linear with little deviation from the main quest until a point toward the end, which, while appreciated would have been nicer to see threaded earlier in the game.\\nCombat could also be tweaked a little more. Particularly early on, it can feel frustrating trying to use the AP gain abilities only to kill the enemies with other characters and end up losing out on the AP so you're less prepared for the next battle without burning recovery items. A 'Defend' option to pass a turn would have been nice at some points. Finally, later on weaknesses/resistances start to matter a lot and it isn't always clear what type of damage every ability does outside of just assumption if they're not labeled. Certain abilities don't seem quite as useful either. The gear system is okay, very simple 'new weapon/armor = clear upgrade' until the end when you make the choice between straight attack power over secondary stats, which is nice. There's a glut of accessories but some of them are so overly useful you don't use the vast majority of them, the DLC addresses this a little but maybe a 2nd accessory slot would've alleviated a lot of this.\\nHowever, these are minor issues. As the first major entry by an indie company it shows a lot of promise and a lot of good ideas. It feels like a good framework for the company to build on in future entries and really this feels like the first Chapter in what could be a developed word. I'd love to see another installment or another game in this style that did something like included a larger party and spent more time in locations and let the story breathe a little more in a larger game world.\\nDefinitely recommend!\",\n",

So far my only grievances are with the abrupt black screen transitions between cutscenes and gameplay, awkward scripting and that the plot is a bit hard to follow at times, but this is just a matter of final polish. The graphics are quite good and the music is fitting, and the game does increase in difficulty overtime so I think it's a good game since it doesn't get too easy.\\nEdit: Now that I've completed the game I gotta say I was a bit too harsh with passing judgment. You sorta get used to the things I mentioned above so those details aren't really any major issues. I think the reason I found myself skipping the plot all the time tho was because of lack of little character drawings by the dialog boxes. Having those could really aid in expressing the characters emotions since you can see their reactions and facial expressions, but also engage you in the story.

But I felt there could have been so much more as far as customization of the robots.

On her great adventure she must make friends and enemies alike while overcoming various challenges by cooking and fighting/hunting.\\n*Insert Shia Labeouf meme here*\\nThe gameplay is a mixture of rpg/sidescrolling/platformer/poyopoyo/puzzler/beat\\'em up elements. Matches consist of hunting, gathering and cooking.\\nHunting/fighting is really basic beat \\'em up styled combat with various moves like neutrals and directional combos like up-X or down-Y. \"Beauty in simplicity\" as the game would describe. While hunting you gather incredients to make your dishes once enough you get to cook.\\nCooking is a matching puzzlegame where basic rule is match 3 of the same to advance taste gems to bigger levels adding flavour and points to you dish. While doing all this you must have a theme incredient in your dish or points will be detucted from your dish also you must appeal 1 to 3 judges with diffirent tastes. All this under a timelimit, trust me you will be on serious pressure once you get to the 1-5 minute marks and you haven\\'t even stared on the dishes. Just like in real kitchens where EVERY second counts.\\nYou can buy cookware, cooking aids and combat aids to make your hunting and cooking easier. My favourite combo of cookwares allways included of a combopan, a cutting board and an slowcooker oven.\\nOverall gameplay feels solid with customizable and tight controlls and matches are just enough difficult.\\nThis game also features voiceacting on the main storylines, which is understandable. Not all sidelines need to be spoken. IMO voiceacting could\\'ve used teeny-tiny bit more depth.\\nVisually Battle Chef Brigade is very pleasing to the eyes with hand drawn characters and backgrounds. Music in this game is also very good but nothing too fancy. Just enough of... that something.\\nAbsoletulely great game with amazing visuals, music and gameplay elements with challenges and daily events. This game will cause stress and pressure while cooking. 8/10!\\nVive la Brigade!',\n",

       "  'text': 'So I just completed Shadows of Adam over this weekend (the game is around 10-13 hours max) and as someone whom was around and played the games in my youth this game is clearly a love letter to (it looks and plays like Final Fantasy 6, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest + Lufia 2 had a love child), I have to say it was an enjoyable experience, (with a few writing and tone hiccups along the way).\\nThe Battle System is surprisingly decent, although granted there were more then a few abilities I simply never used as I quickly figured out it was a better idea to spam the lower-mid range AP usage abilities with buffs up then the higher ones that left you with no AP. Honestly it was hard for me to NOT rely on just buffing Asrael\\'s magic and using Double Up on her and then AoEing the enemies down later on in the game. With all the AoE abilities the enemies had access to, I just wanted to end the fights as fast as possible so I wouldn\\'t be worn down for the Boss fights.\\nLet me get into some pros and cons:\\nPros\\n-----\\n- Beautfiul game with very nice retro graphic style and sprite art. I wish more companies would go this way instead of the polygon crap as I think it lends a ton of character.\\n- Great soundtrack that feels like it could have been in an 16 bit RPG.\\n- Battle System was very good (but could use a few tweaks both for what enemies use and what the characters get access to).\\n- Decent pacing; I don\\'t think it\\'s anywhere near as well crafted as say Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy 6, but it never feels like you\\'re underpowered for what you\\'re facing (except towards the latter half of the game, see below for more on that).\\nCons\\n-----\\n- Some of the writing felt very, very, VERY \"In-Jokey\" in regards to the characters and some of the enemies you meet. I\\'m sure the Devs get a kick out of it, but as someone sitting down playing the game it tried my patience more then once. Talon (in a few scenes) and the Kefka wannabe villain (to me) were the biggest culprits of this.\\n- Enemy balance issues. The toughest enemy to fight in the game isn\\'t the last boss (by far), but random enemies you\\'ll run into that are impossible to hit if they buff themselves and/or have magic AoE attacks that hit everyone for moderate damage they can spam. Oh and they counter AND double hit too. If you\\'ve played this game around halfway or three-quarters of the way through you\\'ll know the enemies I\\'m talking about. A group of 3 of them with buffed HP + a tank monster would\\'ve been a tougher last boss then what we got.\\n- World map is DAMN small. Like... I got the airship and was legitimately looking forward to exploring, and quickly realized flying around I had already seen 95% of what there was to see doing the main storyline...? It made me wonder if they shouldn\\'t have bothered with a world map or airship at all.... or they were going to make the game much longer but ran into the developer hell of getting it out...? Not sure which it is but it was EXTREMELY disappointing. (Imagine if there were 3-5 other continents worth of stuff equivalent to the first 2 that you could start quest lines on. This game would instantly be an amazing classic instead of just good/very good).\\n- Give us some different puzzles! The pushing the block ones were cool, but it\\'d have been great if each dungeon had their own unique puzzles to solve, (and maybe have the last dungeon be a culmination of them).\\n- Nitpicky ... but I always hate games that give you items that negate melee damage.... but they don\\'t matter as every single enemy spams magical attacks (or counts stuff that SHOULD be considered physical attacks such as bleed AoEs as magical) thus making that item fairly useless. I\\'m looking at you Wraith Shield.\\nAnyways... overall it was a very well done game and easily the best RPG-throwback I\\'ve played here on Steam. Hopefully the Devs either make a sequel to this or take what they learned and produce something that\\'s a step above this. Recommended.',\n",

The game play is overly simplified by highlighting the clues in the conversation rather than allowing players to spot them, Many of the mini puzzles have more than one way to complete but the game will only accept one version so, unless you cheat, you may take several attempts trying to find the acceptable answer.\\nThe \"Training Day\" steam achievement is difficult to achieve whilst also going for the \"Genius\" achievement as there is a limit on the number of keys you can create and if you are not using hints you cant clear your key chain. If this happens and you are a completist you can just start a new game.\\nDespite all the above and the poor score I would recommend this game to anyone who has had a stroke or brain injury as well as for young players as there are enough challenges to build/rebuild neural pathways.\\n54:100',\n",

Attempting to navigate both halves of each puzzle simultaineously can occasionally tax your dexterity, but very rarely are you required to do that. Most, if not all, of the puzzles can be solved in small steps, moving one stick at a time. If you are into puzzle games, but are worried that splitting your attention between two different independent characters would be frustrating, that isn't the focus of this game. And honestly, it feels good to just swim the two little squid guys around.\\nThat said, the times that I did solve both sides of the puzzle simultaneously were very satisfying, and I would have been happy with some levels that required that sort of plan, practice, execute loop. Thumb gymnastics might not be for everyone, but I think it would make a nice addition to the core package of semispheres. I can understand not including those types of levels in the main story mode though. As caveates go, wanting more of an already satisfying, enjoyable game is hardly a criticism.\\nI really enjoyed my time with the game, and I could see myself revisiting it when I have forgotten the puzzle solutions.\",\n",

In the case of this game, nobody is pointing out that this game is NOT a realistic simulation of a World War II battle.   It is not even close to a realistic simulation.     I recommend this game only because it is a good strategy game, the same as I would recommend chess to someone, but this is not a World War II battle simulation.   I played other war games on my main steam account that are accurate and realistic when it comes to World War II battles, but this game is not even close.\\nFor one thing, you can only move units from ONE region a turn which is totally unrealistic.     It is impossible to do multiple battles across multiple regions, which is what would occur in real life.  They had radio communication in 1945 and they could communicate and plan simultaneous attacks on multiple fronts in those days.   Or even the individual commanders of each unit may of decided by chance, to attack at the same time as someone else.      Not being able to have simultaneous battles originating from multiple regions is totally unrealistic in this game and makes this game as far from a realistic World War II battle simulation as you can get.\\nA different reviewer pointed out that it makes the game more strategic and makes you think more by having that feature (only being able to move units from one region per turn) and I do agree with him.    But that reviewer neglected to point out how unrealistic it makes the game, and some buyers may be looking for a realistic simulation of a World War II battle.   Personally I prefer this feature and like the fact it makes you think a lot about what units you want to move first in a day.    Just to avoid confusion, you get enough turns in a day, that you are able to move all your units on the map.   The thing this game does, is make you decide which units to move first.   You can\\'t move or attack from multiple regions at the same time.     As I said, I recommend this game as a good strategy game.   I just don\\'t recommend it as a realistic simulation.\\nAnother way this game is not realistic is it goes to unrealistic extremes on unit supply.  In real life, units would receive supplies that would last a few days or even a week.     They didn\\'t receive supplies only for 1 day at a time, as far as I know.     If a unit got stuck behind enemy lines, it could survive and fight back for atleast a week.   It might have to ration its food and it might have to search the countryside for food, but it could survive and fight back for atleast a week.    In this game, if a unit is cut off from supply for little over a day, it then becomes an \"isolated unit\" and it is UNABLE to fight back.    The unit just sits there when attacked and doesn\\'t defend itself.    That is a unit that was cut off from supply for just a little over a day.    Makes absolutely no sense at all, is not historically accurate, and is not realistic.    But again, it makes you think more having to worry about units becoming isolated and cut off from supply in the game, so while it makes the game totally unrealistic, it also makes it a better strategy game.  I actually resigned after the first 3 days out of 8 days in a scenario against the computer AI in a game, where I selected Bradley as an opponent and played the endgame scenario, because the computer kept cutting off the supply lines for my units.   My units weren\\'t able to move and I was screwed, so I didn\\'t see any point to continue, though I probably could of won the game due to the ridiculously little victory points needed to win.   I usually set personally goals for myself in the game when playing against the computer to make things more interesting.   But back on topic:  This is a very fun game to play and is very challenging because of having to worry about keeping all your units in supply and not even losing supply for a single day.   I think this is what the developers were aiming for, more strategy at the cost of realism.\\nI can go on about several other ways this game is unrealistic, but one of the big ones is the calendar.    You can look at the calendar and see a list of the exact dates when the enemy will receive reinforcements and the exact reinforcements they are getting is listed.     How unrealistic can you get.    This information should not be given to the player, or be available to the player.      You should have no clue when and what reinforcements the enemy is getting, as you would in real life.     But I think this game does it that way, to again make it more strategy oriented while it makes it totally unrealistic.      You can plan ahead your moves and base them around what troops the enemy will be getting.     There is also no fog of war, so you see all the reinforcements on the map.   But this game is like chess, it is a good strategy board game, where you get to see all the pieces of your opponent at all times.   So you can plan your moves around that, and I actually like the fact it does it.\\nSo the question is do you care that the game is unrealistic, or do you care more that it is a good strategy game that is tough and requires a lot of thinking and planning?     I recommend this game as a good strategy game, and other reviewers do the same.     I am only pointing out, what all the other reviewers neglected to do, that the game is unrealistic, so those buyers who don\\'t want a game like that will know in advance.     I personally like this game a lot, I enjoy playing against the challenging computer AI, and once I get tired of playing against the computer AI then I will seek multiplayer opponents.    This is a very nice strategy boardgame.   It doesn\\'t bother me that it is unrealistic, because it is a whole lot of fun and makes you think a lot when playing about your moves.   As I hinted at in another paragraph, I set personal goals for myself when playing against the computer to make it more challenging.   For example, if playing as the axis player, I may set a goal of getting a certain amount of victory points by a certain day and also having a certain number of units exit the map by that day.    By setting difficult goals for myself, and considering myself as losing if I don\\'t meet the goals, I made the game a lot more challenging and intersting to play.    So a suggestion: Anyone who buys the game can do the same thing.   Just use your imagination for personal goals to set, and don\\'t cheat, if you can\\'t achieve your personal goals then you lost so you have to resign.     I thought of over a dozen possible personal goals to set in the game, to make the game more challenging.   Anything you can imagine, can be a personal goal.   Achieving a certain number of victory points by a certain day in a scenario, Acceptable losts  (losing only a certain number of armor units and certain number of infantry units by the end of a scenario),  Defeating a certain number of enemy units (certain number of armor units and a certain number of infantry units),   Exiting the map with a certain number of units when playing as the axis player, Defeating a certain number of British units  (those units are brown in color and stay to the west of the river until you are adjacent then they can move east), Preventing the axis player from gaining control of any space that gives victory points  even for a single turn  (if the axis player gains control for a single turn, then you have to resign because you lost), and so on.   There are over a dozen and even more then that, possible personal goals you can set to make the game more challenging when playing against the computer.\\nI had one other suggestion.   Most new players will play the tutorial, and that is useful but the tutorial leaves a lot of details out.    So my suggestion is to take the time to read the manual and I\\'m not talking about the in-game manual.   Go to the store page for the manual and read that one.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Xenon Valkyrie wants to be Spelunky with RPG elements. It comes just close enough to see what it was going for, but ultimately it falls short.\\nThe main issue is its lack of depth. There are no meaningful strategic decisions to be made either in resource management or in putting a loadout together. The advancement you have control over is only simple numeric improvements in stats you already have; weapons you get to choose between differ only in simple numeric damage and appearance. As a result, the game is just an exercise in learning how to engage each enemy-type and hazard safely, and then advancing through the levels to the end.\\nThe most disappointing thing about this game is that it's almost there. The implemented mechanics all work. The spritework and music and physics are all of surprisingly good quality by comparison. However, the team just seems to have neglected to include mechanics that would give the game anything really unique to set it apart. Any given floor of the dungeon has some combination of normal enemies, simple traps, containers with possible money in them, and possibly big monsters with keys / a chest to use a key on (which contains only a weapon with a different damage value than your current weapon of that type), but nothing else. They don't have special interactions or challenges or meaningful opportunities to try a high-risk high-reward play.\\nThere are various other things that make the game clumsy (having four usable abilities, but having to cycle between them rather than mapping them to separate buttons? Really?), but one can learn to work with them and they feel sort of forgivable, but really the simple boringness of this game's main gameplay makes it impossible to recommend.\",\n",

The overall game is pretty fun, though there are only what appear to be a few voice actors out of the 20 talking characters in the game, making it somewhat cheesy sometimes (Much like Lovecraft's work). There is also a game breaking glitch toward the end of the game making it impossible to finish. This isn't even worth the time getting it at such a low price.

There are five basic game mechanics that you can use to manipulate the surroundings.\\nThe combination of these mechanics generally provides for interesting problems but even though I had fun playing the levels, there is one major downside: in my opinion the learning curve is just to flat which sort of makes the levels too easy to solve. I finished the game with all achievements in less than three hours which means that average solving time for each puzzle was around three minutes. So I can't help but think that there could have been a much bigger amount of more challenging puzzles.\\nDon't get me wrong, in each puzzle you have to find out first what to do. But in most puzzles it's just not that diffcult to figure out and then to implement. I recall only three puzzles that really challenged me because of the amount and positioning of available items. In most puzzles the options you have quite clearly indicate what you have to do.\\nSo while I recommend this game as a nice simplistic puzzler I also have to mention that I think it is not worth more than 5€/$.\",\n",

The art is cute and unique (and you'll always recognize a semispheres level when you see one).  I'm a bit old, so it really does do a bit of a workout on my brain.  If I was to pick one mechanic I love, it is the guards.\\nNow, I'm an indie by trade and a strong believer of the indie scene.  What does that mean?  Well, realistically, if you buy this game, your cash is going to a small indie developer that did something super cool so he can spend time to make something even better.

The player assumes the role of a police detective whose sister mysteriously goes missing. As you investigate her disappearance you quickly find yourself pulled into quite a unique situation. You become a member, codenamed Gunspell, of a powerful Order that protects the Earth against creatures from the darkside. Yeah it sounds like the plot from one of those cheezy Saturday night SyFy channel movies but bear with me it gets better. During the course of the game, your travels will take you to a number of strange yet beautiful worlds. You'll also battle a large amount of bad guys as well as monsters of legend such as vampires, succubi, ghosts and werewolves...I actually fought a werewolf who was wielding a chainsaw...how cool is that?! Battles of course take place in puzzle format as you attempt to match 3 or more gems on the battlefield to build mana and power for your chosen armaments. There are also a number of available spells, weapons and armors to further enhance your character.\\nGraphically this game is eyecatching. The gem battlefield looks great and is well animated. The special effects that occur when you make a match 3, cast a spell or use a weapon are vivid and look fantastic. The handrawn art of the characters, worlds and various items such as weaponry is also expertly done. Sound effects are loud and crisp just as they should be in any great match 3 game. The musical score, however, is not so memorable.\\nI enjoyed Gunspell but there are some minor issues that need mentioning. There seems to be some gameplay unbalances where you find yourself easily defeating one enemy after another, some you will defeat after making only one move, only to get to a certain opponent and find yourself horribly outclassed and losing time after time again. Unbalances like that always infuriate me. Gunspell is definitely not the most polished game in the match 3 genre but it can be fun for a time if you're a match 3 fan. Worth a try but not for everyone.\",\n",

The AI is deffinitely not great, the afformentioned turn system makes PBEM last for days (and so the fast pace of the game quickly disappears), if not weeks, and large chunks of in-game documentation are plagued by historical corectness and/or are ported straight from the iOS with disregard to the change of platform.\\nDespite the afformentioned problems I strongly recommend buying this title, especially if you are new to the genre or crave for a more-than-usual casual experience.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"A bizarre and incomprehensible computer program I can only assume was an attempt at mimicking a video game. This game will sap your sanity and make you lose your mind, just like the works of HP Lovecraft it oft porports to be inspired by. However, this is not because the game is scary, but simply because it's puzzles are so mind-numbingly boring, tedious, and oftentimes unsolvable by way of infuriating bugs and awful game design. The characters in this game, such as they are, are even flatter and less believable than Lovecraft's own, with stilted voice acting and stuttering, puppety models that look like they were all controlled by tiny spiders, rather than any kind of individual personality. The most competently voice acting role in the game comes in the form of a brain in a jar, whose performance is the most human and sane of all of the characters. However, even a stellar performance (of which this was not) could not save the droning, boring dialogue the actor had to read.\\nThe story, which I am assured exists, judging by the story credits that come with the game, is a completely incomprehensible retelling of the Case of Charles Dexter Ward. There are several discrepancies that point towards the creator of the game being ignorant of occult symbology, such as the inclusion of the Star of David as an evil, occult symbol. I am convinced that this was an inclusion made from a place of ignorance rather than malice, as there are no signs of any Zionist Conspiracy theory that I could understand within the game's text.\\nThe graphics, though spartan and often incomprehensible, a running theme with this game, are also bland and inoffensive, lacking even the slightest spark of art direction or competency.\\nThe most notable aspect of this game is the bugs. Several, large, game-breaking monstrous bugs that thankfully render the game unplayable past the library scene. Having watched a longplay of the remaining gameplay, I felt truly blessed that I did not have to suffer the game further.\\nOn a more positive note, having played several other bad games recently, this game has made me think twice about their quality. They shine in comparison to this one, and I will count my blessings every time I suffer through another bad game, because truly they could not have been as bad as this one.\\nLike the titular Necronomicon, this game contains ye liveliest awfulness, and perusing it for more than a couple of seconds will destroy a man's soul and render him insane. For that, I commend the creators, for they have crafted an experience of mind-destroying awfulness and incomprehensible realities which man was not meant to view. Beware, player, for if you dredge this awful beast up from it's essential salts, have on hand something that you can put it down with.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Semispheres by developer Vivid Helix is a 2D puzzle game that applies the concept of split-screen to a smart, fun, and relaxing experience. Each level splits your computer screen in half, with one of your “semispheres” on the left side and the other on the right. If you are using keyboard controls, the WASD keys control the left semisphere and the arrow keys control the right semisphere. (You can also play with a controller, which is what the game recommends and what I used. Each joystick controls its respective semisphere with this control scheme.)\\nThe puzzles all have the same objective: move both semispheres to their goal spots. Obviously, it’s not always that simple – there are “guards” that will instantly send a semisphere back to its beginning location if that semisphere enters the guard’s field of view. The game provides you with various tools and abilities to allow you to bypass the guards and reach the goal, such as an echo which will cause any guards within its radius to leave their post and investigate the noise. There are also “portals” that allow the semispheres to interact with each other’s worlds. (Fortunately, there are no rude AI units promising you cake in order to lure you to your death in this game.) As the game progresses, it introduces you to more interesting abilities that require a little more thought when trying to navigate the puzzles\\nRead the full review on',\n",

It may start out slow, but picks up soon and the player will quickly become invested in the story and setting, as well as get in a groove with the great stealth and combat. The boss fights are great and are a perfect difficulty for casual gamers. Harder difficulty settings are there for more experienced or hardcore players. The main issues are constant backtracking and the repetitive nature of the game. I recommend gamers to buy it during a sale.',\n",

The tournament was definitely the highlight of this game, I was getting genuinely pumped while doing the cooking battles. Knees weak, palms were sweaty during the Final Three.\\nAs is though, the game is extremely satisfying from start to finish, but it\\'s hard to convince myself to play through it again. As I said, the campaign is very heavily story driven. There\\'s a lot of obligatory puzzles and \"adventures\" you have to do which weren\\'t as satisfying for me. And I don\\'t want to slog through those just to get to the good parts again.\\nThe Daily Battles are nice, but it\\'s not the same as being in an actual elimination tourney.\\nDefinitely try this game though. Seriously. Surprisingly cool and addicting, loveable characters, great art, fun and holy crap surprisingly challenging too. It starts all coy and♥♥♥♥♥♥ then suddenly the clock starts ticking and you\\'ve got 3 judges waiting for a perfect meal and you just got thrown into a map you\\'ve never been before with monsters and ingredients you\\'ve never seen before and it\\'s like \"AAAAAAAAAAA--\"\\nOn that note, an encyclopedia with all the ingredients you\\'ve encountered or will encounter would\\'ve been nice too. So you can prepare at least a little before being thrown into the ring again. There\\'s a practice kitchen, but it only has one of the areas. But that\\'s a minor gripe.

The game ramps up not only competitor's skill, but also the complexity of the puzzles themselves, making you master new elements as the game goes on.\\nThe writing is solid, and does a really good job of making you get invested in the characters. It is, for the most part, not some vast, world-spanning plot, but about a small group of people's individual struggles, which is a REALLY refreshing change.\\nThe love for Iron Chef drips from every pore of this game, and the creators have made a wonderful tribute and an excellent game in it's own right.\",\n",

This is a great way to read through the original story with visual aids instead of reading plain text.\\n+ Visually the background images and characters are very well drawn with a lot of detail, great facial expressions, and colorful outfits. Has a very anime-like style.\\n+ Many of the non-human characters from Alice in Wonderland are portrayed as cute girls in this visual novel. For instance, the White Rabbit is a girl with white hair and bunny ears.\\n+ Relaxing soundtrack\\n- I felt like there could have been more images. Sometmes you read through very long sections without much ever happening in the background to portray what is going on in the story. (only 12 backgrounds)\\n- This is more of a personal note, but the creators of this game literally took someone else's work (copied word for word), and are profiting off of it. I mean, yes it's a 150 year old book, but I feel as if it is a tad bit lazy not to create your own story or perhaps a spin-off of the original.\\n~ I encountered a bug which would make the text box and all the buttons disappear if I enlarged the screen too large or went full screen. I'm sure this will get fixed, and it wasn't a big issue playing in a smaller window.\",\n",

Let's take all the superheroes in the Avengers.... and smush them INTO ONE!!\\nHeck yeah!  We could build the game around a stealthy, sharpshooting supergenius with a cloaking device and cybernetic arm who crashes a plane in the early 20th century and in order to survive has to build himself super-robot armors that turn him into a hulking, giant-monster-fighting badass!\\n\\nGoliath is an action-RPG and crafting hybrid where you play as a heroic inventor from a retro-steampunk world who has just crashed his plane into a mysterious chain of islands.  Unfortunately, your new 'home'  already hosts a variety of menacing mythical monsters and robotic nightmares.  Your trusty pistol and cloaking device make you more than a match for the smaller specimens, but this strange new world is also populated by plenty of hostile critters who happen to be quite a bit larger than you.  The obvious solution to this:  Build giant super-robot Goliath suits of your own in order to beat any massive monstrosities  senseless!\\nThe gameplay is a fun mix of traditional isometric action-RPG fighting along with the ever-popular collect-'n'-craft.  The main point of crafting in Goliath is to combine a wide array of a natural ingredients into 'Goliath' robot-suits.  These Goliaths are made from a variety of materials (wood, stone, etc) that each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and can be further customized with additional weapons and new skills as you level.  You are free to explore the world on foot with your pistol and cloaking device in order to find new items and materials without stomping through every tree/monster in sight, but wielding Goliaths is naturally the more entertaining aspect of the game.  After all, who doesn't like to run around as a super-giant-robot and break things as they please?\\nMechanically, the visuals of the game are well done, with the cartoony world fitting extremely well with the fun, comic-book type gameplay.  The audio is nothing special, but nice enough in terms of background noise.  You do have the option to use a gamepad to control everything, which is certainly a plus.  However. you should be wary going in that there is a bit of unexplained learning curve as you figure out how to progress, both in the story and crafting your goliaths, but this is nothing a trip to the forum can't solve.\\nAll in all, Goliath is is a spectacular fun-filled romp through a world of giant monsters that I highly recommend trying out.  With the current glut of crafting-focused early-access 'games' that offer very little story or point beyond exploring the world and building enough stuff to survive, I find it invigorating to play a crafting game that actually plays *like a game*.  Goliath succeeds in large part because it uses its giant-robot crafting system purely as an enhancement rather than a crutch.  With a fun story, nifty Godzilla-monster-battling gameplay, and the ability to make and control a variety of awesome giant robots, Goliath is a game with\\n!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Goliath is one of those games it’s hard to compartmentalize, it’s a survival game while also being and RPG and brawler too. There’s no shame in this, many great game straddle the genres making something new and goliath want desperately to be the next. You are placed in the role of a 1930’s fighter pilot landed on a strange world, who must make behemoth type mechanical automations to survive the hostile indigenous creatures that inhabit this strange environment. Pretty cool idea but things are never that clear cut.\\nThe story is the first place things start to fall apart, you know who you are kind of and you are taught about the world by a voice on your radio claiming to be you co-pilot. I’m not going to give away spoilers but things get odd very quickly. As you start to discover the world around you things get stranger more still, with fox like creatures and rat like creatures becoming friendly towards you depending on the choices you make, it’s a great idea but through the entirety of it all the game explains very little and this makes it hard to invest in the world. Your character just gains the ability to make these technological marvels that are goliaths, he just knows how to use teleporters and fix them with no explanation why. The cardinal sin though is that the game offers you conversational options but you’re never sure if you’re moving the story the way you want. This might seem odd but your character is such a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that it’s sometimes hard to tell if the choice you make is the good or bad one. He really is a bit of a prick that way, for a hero this isn’t a good thing.\\nBut hey what does story mater when you can drive giant robots around and that’s true, apart from they really aren’t as giant as your lead to believe. The reality is your character is a little shorter than most of the creatures you encounter and your goliath is a little taller, it’s almost like you strapped on body armour and a pair of stilts. Not exactly the “Shadow of Colossus” idea the Goliath title might suggest. There’s just no feeling of power about them and they take damage so easily, it’s more glass cannon than raging hulk.\\nThe mechanics also take a big hit too with the keyboard and mouse being virtually unusable and it only being when you use a controller that the game really works. For a PC game to make such a bad job of the K&M controls is shameful it’s just a mess. Even when you switch to a controller there are still issue, attacking and moving around become far more natural, but the game lacks the ability to move the camera lower than its almost top down view giving you no peripheral vision what so ever. This combined with overly complex to navigate menus and an overly difficult upgrade system make it a turn off.\\nDifficulty is an issue to, as the game doesn’t so much ramp as you tend to just avoid creature for the most part as you will lose. That’s really it, you avoid and the AI is dumb enough to let you. It again comes back to the fact you never get a sense of power with a goliath, it’s more a case of extending your health bar long enough to reach the next goal.\\nOh those goals too! Go here, go there, go everywhere and achieve very little with very little in the way of plot development. You could spend your life going back and forward in this game just talking to the next person before they tell you to talk to someone else. Occasionally they will chuck in something to defeat before you can talk to someone and then you’re back to it again and god it’s tiresome.\\nIf there is one area though it’s the visuals, the style is something a kin to if you crossed the looney toons with anime and strangely it works stunningly. But still even cranked up to max settings it doesn’t look as good as the screen shots and trailers do, not far off but noticeable all the same. It’s a good looker all the same but with the art style not really pushing my system I wonder why it couldn’t have looked as good as they show it could, why the down grade?\\nI suspect it’s to do with the engines performance, I think this because even though my GPU doesn’t break a sweat and my CPU even less so the game still stutters and lags horrendously. There’s no real reason for this I can see as there is plenty of power left in my system for it to use, it just doesn’t. On top of this the loading times are some of the longest I’ve come across in ages and while I’m not running it off an SSD it really shouldn’t take as long as it does. Thankfully after the initial load things speed up a little, but I honestly believe the reason we don’t get peripheral vision and micro stutters is all related to the engine having major issues they have tried to hide.\\nWhen I asked for this game I asked because I looked great and I really wanted to play it, it really caught my eye and imagination. But now after spending some time with it and experiencing its gameplay or lack thereof I just feel a little cheated. For an indie game it’s not cheap and just because it carries the indie title doesn’t mean it should be treated any less harsh than the games of equal price.\\nGoliath is a game I want to recommend but it makes it impossible with it being subpar in almost all areas.',\n",

       "  'text': 'This is an excellent game, with quality close to what you would expect from Square\\'s SNES RPGs.  It is a bit shorter though, maybe about a third of the size that one would expect.  So given that, I would say that this game is worth about $30, yet it only costs $15.\\nGAMEPLAY: The combat system is great!  I would say that it is better than any SNES RPG that I\\'ve played.  The characters each have about a dozen interesting abilities that remain useful until the very end.  Each character only has 100 AP (mana) but it automatically refills 15 points per turn, 30 if you skip your turn.  This encourages you to use a mix of cheap abilities, expensive abilities, basic attacks, and skips.  My one complaint is that the attack resolutions animations are too fast for beginners, though you soon get used to them.\\nSTORY/SETTING: The dialogue is really weak at the beginning but gradually gets better.  They should go back and rewrite the first five hours of the script.  The setting is well done, pretty much your standard fantasy world with enough tweaks to keep it interesting.  The plot is good.  I don\\'t want to talk about the plot too much because that would give it away, but I have no complaints with it.  Although the characters have interesting backstories, the characters themselves are pretty dull.  There isn\\'t any character development.  Curtis being black doesn\\'t make any sense.  The sidequests are few but add to the setting.  I used a spoiler to finish one of the sidequests and had to leave another unfinished because I couldn\\'t find a spoiler. Townspeople have up-to-date dialog when you go back to places.\\nENCOUNTERS/BOSSES: Regular encounters are tough and require the use of special abilities.  You can\\'t just hit \"attack, attack, attack, attack\" and expect to win.  You can\\'t just nuke everything with your strongest abilities either, otherwise you will run out of AP.  So you need to do things intelligently.  Bosses can be tough but mostly you just have to whittle them down.  There are no gimmicks to figure out.  Although most battles are tough... overall the game is actually easy.  I never once lost my whole party.  Monster design is interesting but nothing special.\\nDUNGEONS: The dungeons are laid out well and are just the right size.  There are some tentacle puzzles in the first dungeon that are ok.  A few dungeons later you come across your first sun orb puzzles.  These can be lots of fun.  The orb puzzles start off easy but get harder.  There was one in an optional dungeon that I couldn\\'t solve.  You can save anywhere but there are a few \"save spots\" that restore you to full health, right before boss fights.\\nITEMS/EQUIPMENT: It has all of your standard potions, ethers, elixirs, revives, etc... along with some useless items.  Each character has three slots: weapon, armor, special.  Each weapon and armor goes with a certain character, so you can think of them more along the lines of upgrades.  Near the end there is some variety but for the most part it is obvious which weapon and armor each character should use.  The special items are great, they are like the relics from FF6.  You can really customize your party depending on which relic you give to each character.  You have to make tough choices because you only have one of each relic and you can only put one on each character.\\nART/MUSIC: Great.  The pixel art is consistently beautiful.  The music is great too.\\nPROGRAMMING: Great.  I didn\\'t notice any bugs until the very final battle, and those were just graphical glitches that didn\\'t last.  I couldn\\'t figure out how to remap the controls on my gamepad but the defaults were perfectly good (start=menu, B=action, A=cancel).\\nSUMMARY: Buy this game, tough out the first few hours of poorly written dialog, and then enjoy the rest of the game.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I wanted to wait until I finished the game before leaving a review. I backed this game on Kickstarter and I was really hyped for its release so I didn't want the hype to cloud my judgement. I'm glad to say that even by taking my time, and spreading this game over a few weeks, the game has lived up to my expectations.\\nWe live in an awesome time where indie RPGs are abundant. Unfortunately the barriers to entry are very low with the use of frameworks like RPG Maker. This often leads to games with low effort, poor balance, and unrefined stories. What makes Shadows of Adam stand out is that everything was done from scratch and done very well; from the graphics, game engine, music, and story.\\nI think the game's best feature is its battle system. There are no random battles here! The developers made sure this wouldn't make the game too easy by placing choke points with a guard the needs to be taken out. Monsters don't respawn while you're in a dungeon until you leave to the overworld. This makes for intense dungeon explorations because you might find yourself through the majority of the puzzles only to find yourself rationing your items in fear of having to go back to town to restock.\\nFinding yourself thin on items can force you to come up with different battle strategies to try and conserve your precious AP. You might try and cheese an encounter by finishing off all but one weak enemy and letting it live while you refill your AP through your meditation skill.\\nAlso, there's no such nonsense such as out-of-date abilities. Lightning, the first spell you use, is as relevant at the end of the game as it was at the beginning. This is very much a modern RPG, it tries to remove the annoying bits without trying to reinvent the whole formula.\\nDuring my playthrough I did run into a few bugs. Some were trivial but immersion breaking (loading in the wrong spot when entering a town), some forced me to reload the game (getting stuck behind a one way staircase), and certain puzzle pieces being able to be pushed over water (not game breaking but it made the puzzles a bit more confusing).\\nNone of these ruined the experience but they were there. Fortunately the devs are extremely active on the discussion board and take bug reports very seriously. The bugs mentioned above have all been patched.\\nThere's nothing uglier than being ready for a boss fight only to have him instakill two of your party members with an opening attack. This forced me to throw my strategy out the window and improvise. What's worse is that I later found out that the instakill ability had been patched out of the game in favour of a more fair (but still tough) strategy. Dang you Something Classic!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'RoA1 is complex RPG based on Germany\\'s best selling pen and paper RPG \"The Dark Eye\". The game is very rough around the edges with stiff controls, repetitive graphics and micro management and instant kill dreath-traps; and yet the world of Aventuria is fun to explore and RoA is one of the few game series that tried to get the pen and paper rules as closely as possible onto the screen.\\nWith the classic RPG party of up to six heroes (plus an occasional NPC) you have to travel through and explore the viking-inspired country of Thorwal to find pieces of an old map showing the location of a legendary sword. Find the sword to thwart the impending orc invasion and save Thorwal. The story is as simple as that - but it\\'s not an easy task.\\nTravelling Thorwal is not a cakewalk. Find food and drink or your heroes will die of starvation or thirst. Gather herbs, brew potions and poisons or use them to cure death threatening diseases. Protect your camp or you risk enemy surprise attacks at night. Try to climb a mountain without a rope? Your party better have proper climbing skills or you can wave your heroes goodbye as the game cruelly hurls them down chasms to their deaths. Bottomless pits, rocky old boats that sink without warning - the game loves to kill you without giving you a chance. You better save often. Not enough? One wrong word may upset an NPC carrying one of the precious map pieces you\\'re looking for and you will never get it. No second chances. Miss too many and you cannot complete the game (without the game telling you).\\nTowns and dungeons are explored in old fashioned 3D view à la classic Bard\\'s Tale and Ultima Underworld. Combat takes place turn based on an isometric grid. Traveling across the lands happens on the large map of Thorwal itself.\\nOver twenty years later there are many things that will turn gamers away instantly. The game gives you no quarter. But if you give it an honest chance you may find that exploring Thorwal and its dozens of villages and towns and numerous dungeons will be an adventure to remember for a long time to come.',\n",

       "  'text': \".Story.\\nYou are Andrew Gromov. You and your pilot crash-landed and the smouldering remains of your ship are around you. You’re both uninjured, but separated, and your copilot is able to communicate with you via radio. You’re immediately tasked with setting up camp and, during your tutorial fetch quest, you find out that you’re in a strange world unlike any other—or, rather, a collection of worlds that you can teleport across via the teleportation device in what soon becomes your base of operations. Your task? Find out why you’re here and what’s going on.\\n*The story is, at best, an excuse to keep pressing on, but that didn't bother me. I don't typically look for deep, in-depth plots in my survival games.\\n.Gameplay.\\nGoliath can be played with mouse and keyboard (WASD plus hotkeys) or controller. I personally prefer using a controller if only because using the middle mouse button to turn the camera is uncomfortable for me. More on that later. You’ll gather materials, a task made easier if you're piloting a Goliath, and build structures within a protective field generated by your teleporter. This is home base. Home base teleports when you do, so you'll always have it to fall back to. In your home base, you'll be able to craft--both consumables, equipment for your Goliaths, and Goliaths--as well as store your equipment and spare suits.\\nYou can play as either Gromov or one of three Goliaths he can keep with him. Gromov has the ability to go invisible and also has a gun with which he can protect himself, but he is ultimately made useless by his Goliath unless you're attempting to sneak somewhere. Your Goliaths can also be commanded to stand guard at a location or to follow behind you.\\nOutside of home base, you'll be exploring a decently sized map and engaging in battle with various, giant wildlife. Combat is not random and you can see the enemies as they wander the map.\\n*If you die--and you will--you're instantly returned back to your base camp. You lose some of what's in your inventory, but you can go back to where you died and ransack your own grave in order to reclaim what was lost. You'll also have to spend resources in order to rebuild your broken Goliath.\\nOtherwise, much of your time in Goliath will be spent teleporting from world-to-world in order to complete the main story.\\n.Atmosphere.\\nI’m going to lump graphics and soundtrack together here because they work very well together. From the title screen, you’re greeted by a rock instrumental with Western influences and a fantastic battle scene.\\nSeriously. It’s awesome.\\nThe rest of the game has been lovingly cell-shaded. The biomes, whether hot and arid, cold and snowy, or verdant and teeming with life, were all well-detailed and the way the environments tied into the way your Goliath functions was a nice touch. See my gameplay for an example of the biomes.\\n.Pros and Cons.\\n.Bottom line.\\nGoliath strays from the typical survival formula by including the ability to craft and pilot giant robots. It looks great, plays well, and will keep you entertained for a good while.\\nThere are several tiers of upgrades for your Goliath, skills to unlock as your pilot levels up, buildings to upgrade in your base, and quests to undertake. The landscapes are varied and interesting, though limited in size. Exploration allows you find resources and chests filled with loot, but also runs the risk of running into a monster that’s bigger and badder than your Goliath.\\nIf you’re looking for a survival game with some light RPG elements and you’re not afraid of a bit of grind, Goliath is well worth the price of admission.\",\n",

Unlike others, rather than building yourself a nice customized base of operations, you build yourself giant robots in order to survive!\\nAfter a mysterious plane crash, you awaken to find yourself in a strange land. A brief attempt to explore your surroundings quickly results in your running for your life back to the safety of your burning wreckage. A giant beast has tried to attack you. You realize that in order to survive for any length of time in this strange place, you are going to have to become Iron Man. You speedily turn the wood you have collected into your very first suit, the Wood Goliath. The Wood Goliath is great, it is strong, it can heal in water… and it can really help you see where you are going at night when it catches fire and burns to ash. This burning aspect is something that is actually quite interesting. Not only do you need to avoid fire, you also need to worry about how hot the area you are occupying is. If you find yourself at high noon in a desert in a wooden Goliath, you will quickly find yourself in a useless burned to ashes Goliath. Luckily, the Stone Goliath thrives when it is hot. There are at least four main types of Goliaths you can build, each one having variants you can craft after completing the required experiments. Each of the main styles of Goliath have their advantages and disadvantages so you need to weigh your options when selecting which one you want to use. If you need a hand, you can actually craft and deploy additional Goliaths to help you in a tough fight.\\nCrafting isn’t limited just to building the Goliaths though; you can craft and equip various weapons on the Goliaths. Some of them even have elemental effects that can really come in handy if used properly. In addition to weapons, you can also craft items. Some items allow you to craft new things and base upgrades, others will help you or your Goliath heal in battle, and there are those used as offensive weapons by strategically placing them on the ground.\\nYou can actually play the game without using a Goliath. It really ramps up the difficulty in combat, but in general, it allows you to move around the map without drawing as much attention to yourself. Armed with only a pistol and cloaking device, you can creep around the map looting treasures guarded by hostile creatures. If you were to thump on up in a Goliath, you would easily incur their wrath, but on foot, you might just get out of there without them even knowing you were there!\\nThe game itself involves multiple fragment worlds, each one consisting of its own biome. Each one is procedurally generated so if you replay the game, everything will look different. You move between these worlds using the teleporter in your base. As you quest for the various factions, you will be sent back and forth between multiple world fragments in order to complete their request. There are also dungeons to explore.\\nGraphically, the game looks great. There is enough variety that each area does feel different from the last, even if it is based on the same basic biome theme. There are some graphical glitches that are common to procedurally generated games where you will encounter floating shrubs and trees, but this is not overly common. Enemies sometimes also get trapped inside of objects. One thing that I think was a really nice touch is that when you are thumping around in your giant Goliath, you smash small shrubs beneath your feet while on foot you do not. Also trees get pushed out of the way, causing them to bend to one side and then spring back into place once your Goliath (or any large creature) passes by it. The sounds in the game can be a bit understated and sometimes glitch off at times but it rarely is an issue. The music does help you get into the spirt of things though, and while I have read others mentioning that the Goliaths should sound heavier with more stated thuds as they walk, I feel that would get annoying fast, so I am glad they are understated.\\nI do have a few complaints that I can’t go without saying. I generally have no issues with looking past minor graphical and sound issues to the point where I sometimes don’t even bother to mention them. One thing that can really get under my skin though is the camera. The default camera in this game, in my option, is bad. It doesn’t really offer you much in the way of control for it and really restricts your forward view. You get a nice ring around you and you can see all of that really nicely but you often run head first into a concentrated enemy area without even realizing it until it is too late. After struggling with the camera, I ended up editing the INI to change the camera angle myself. Once I did that, the view in this game was fantastic and no longer worthy of complaint. It felt so much better seeing much further forward with minimal rear view. Rather than a high floating camera that is placed slightly behind the character, I now have a much lower, more shoulder mounted view of the game. This is even more noticeable when on foot in comparison to being in a Goliath. For example, knowing there is a lake nearby I could spin in circles and never see it with the default camera, but could easily spot it with my modified one. Luckily I read the Developer is looking into the camera and plans to implement changes for it, so hopefully soon the editing of the INI file will no longer be necessary for me to enjoy playing it.\\nAnother complaint I have is the fact that while the Developer knows what they are talking about or referring to, I often have no idea. To unlock new variants of a Goliath, you have to perform experiments. These experiments are basically performing a certain action to a certain unit often in a certain biome with a certain Goliath type. As an example, it has you killing 15 spitting (shooting) spiders with the Stone Goliath using only heavy blows. That one is pretty easy to figure out. I know what a spider is, and I can figure out if they are shooting stuff at me, that it is probably the right one. But most of the time, I have no idea what the creature looks like, or where I can find it in order to complete the experiment. This leads me to try randomly doing the required action on everything I encounter and then checking my progress for that experiment. That sounds simple enough, but the creature could be on any of the world fragments, it could be in multiple, might only be in one. I might not even have unlocked the area it is in yet! Some kind of tracker that points you in the right direction, or name labels or something would really help you figure out what you are doing. The Developers also stated they are looking into that as well. Lastly, other than the basic explanation at the start, you either have to learn everything by trial and error or by paying attention to the load screens.\\nSome things only seem to work when using a game pad (or else I could never find the right key combination on the keyboard) while other things only seem to work when using the keyboard. You can’t use both at the same time as using one deactivates the other. For example, I can call up the map when playing with keyboard and mouse but can’t find it with the gamepad, and I can’t figure out how to put my Goliaths on auto-pilot other than with my gamepad. So I have to make a choice, map or assistance in battles. Either way, it would be nice if there was some indicator what the gamepad buttons stated on the loading screen translated to if using only the keyboard and mouse (much easier to aim with) or what the map button is when using a gamepad.\\nIn conclusion, Goliath is a wonderful action adventure survival game with the unique twist of giant robots. If you are fan of survival games, you should definitely check out Goliath!',\n",

       "  'text': \"In Goliath you’ll find yourself playing a young pilot who crashes on a mysterious island. With limited survival gear and a radio to contact your now lost co-pilot you’ll get to explore the lands meeting new factions, enemies and most importantly you’ll get to craft some of the awesome Goliaths in the game. With limited information fed to you from your co-pilot you’ll need to find out where you are and just how to get back home\\nAt first Goliath seems pretty similar to many survival games as you’ll quickly find yourself gathering some wood and other resources around you to survive your first night in this strange land. But you’ll very soon find yourself embroiled in much deeper affairs. Once completing a few quick starter quests you’ll find yourself ready with your own base which you can upgrade and most likely enough materials to craft your first Goliath. Goliaths are essentially large robots you can control directly as though they are a suit of armour, or order to follow you around as slaves/pets. Goliaths are big and very strong and will be the only protection you have in this world, but fear not, there are many types of Goliaths and each has it’s own perks. Though you only start with one Goliath you can craft, as you continue on you’ll be able to learn how to make new types, often stronger in some form than the last. Goliaths can also be upgraded and equipped with one of the many weapons you’re able to craft at your base and each can have both a ranged and melee weapon at the same time. Not only do Goliaths have different ability types they also react differently with your environment which can turn the tide of battle in your favour if you utilize this properly. For example stone Goliaths are faster in hot environments whereas wooden ones can heal in water.\\nThere are main quests for you to follow as well as some side quests but mostly the story is linear and it’s not easy to get lost or fall off your chosen path which is appreciated because many RPGs have far too much filler now just to bulk the gameplay hours. Most of the quests you receive will be from the various factions you encounter BUT you may only do quests for factions you are on good terms with so you may want to think twice about who you attack and who you befriend.\\nThe graphics are nice and run smoothly most of the time but sometimes I feel like there is a little hiccup/stutter when i’m moving on occasion. The soundtrack that plays in the background is very awesome and adds a little something extra, especially to combat as it seems to fit the mood perfectly. Something about smashing mobs in with my giant fists just feels better with great background music.\\nThough I am loving Goliath I do have to mention some of the things that bother me, the first being a lack of explanation. Maybe I missed something but I’m learning everything from the tips when I teleport without finding too much information anywhere else. Things like how to have your Goliaths follow you and where to find the objectives for upgrading your Goliaths should be clearly explained to you as I don’t tend to pay attention to the loading screens. There are also things you are told to find and not given any indication at all of where to find them or even what they look like. This is freaking annoying on your first timed quest and just had me running around like a maniac killing everything.  Another small issue is objects floating off of the ground slightly and enemy mobs getting caught in them but this is a superficial one and didn’t really affect my gameplay, it was just very noticeable. Lastly I find things can be a tad ‘grindy’ because some of the enemies are just so damn hard to kill that I find myself needing to level first. I don’t see any difficulty settings either so it seems it's grind or nothing.\\nOverall Goliath is a fantastic light RPG with a story i’m enjoying and many hours of gameplay. The addition of a great story and chuckleworthy dialogue makes for a brilliant combination and is well worth the price tag. For those of you on the fence, check out some YouTube gameplay videos, I don’t think the store page does this game justice at all.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'It\\'s good. I got shown this at a friends place. Proceeded to then buy it on Steam for myself.\\nJust note this:\\nThis is not a wargame per se, as soon as you can look beyond that, it becomes much better. For me, being a wargamer this was a hurdle. But once you figure out what it is it becomes a very deep experience.\\nSo what is it then if not a wargame?\\nWell... It\\'s a puzzle game. It is like a mix of \"area activation\" euro style board games and a logic puzzler. The theme is more coincidental, but is a nice touch.\\nThe game has two core concepts, one being the mentioned \"area activation\", a mechanic often seen in trading style board games. It means that a sector of the board is \"activated\" on your turn, and only that, so you may ONLY move units on that sector. All other units have to wait a following turn.\\nThe second concept which is central to the game is the timeline. A unit may only move ONCE every sub-timeline (a day) then it may not move until many turns later (next day). This is where the puzzle thing happens.\\nFor instance, in the first scenario, it is very little about winning over the enemy but a lot about logically figuring out how to reach a certain point in time, given the movement restrictions.\\nIn multiplayer it is the same thing, with the game taking on more of an abstract view of the theme and more of a logic puzzle nature. Like how chess is about battlefield tactics, hence the pieces and move ranges, but it is so abstracted it instead is turned into a logic game of deduction. This is the same.\\nSo wargamers should be aware of this, and instead see it as a thematic puzzle/board gaming hybrid with some great depth.\\nWhen you do that, it becomes VERY enjoyable in it\\'s own right. The small history articles is a nice touch also.',\n",

The battles are challenging without feeling impossible, and the story is interesting, even though it's a little simple at times.

No early game skills that become junk later on.

       "  'text': 'I\\'m making this one a positive right now mostly because there\\'s no \"neutral\" option. I do not think the game is currently worth full price, more on that below.\\nThe core gameplay I really do enjoy. The mix of sidescrolling brawler and match-3 puzzle gameplay is very well done with decent mechanics on both ends that also come together very well. The game has a good selection of items used in both hunting and cooking, and the selection of theme ingredients, judges and hunting grounds for each duel keeps your tactics from going stale like might expect when you know what gems you get from what monsters. You buy some items for currency earned in mini-games between duels, and beating duels awards you items based on your opponents, the order of which you choose. The game\\'s atmosphere and art style are well crafted and tie the experience together thematically. These are my reasons for choosing the \"positive\" review stance. I like the base game experience that much.\\nThat said, the game isn\\'t quite perfectly balanced to maintain proper diversity of gameplay. Towards the end of it, cheese tactics do emerge. Not ones involving actual cheese, the game is more about meat and plants, mind you. But a combination of a certaing cookware piece, inventory item and plant makes the final duel of the game (and the score-related achievements) incredibly easy on normal difficulty, which the game is balanced for. The \"adaptive\" rubber-banding aspect of the normal difficulty means that beating the game in general doesn\\'t require very much skill, and indeed two achievements in the game require feats of self-sabotage that this system allows if you just overload it with defeats. And if you wish to just test yourself by taking suboptimal gear, the game\\'s save system doesn\\'t allow you to capture the moment, as the save is overwritten with every finished match (lowering difficulty but not advancing on defeats) and there are no in-game means of copying saves, so playing against the same opponent repeatedly will just weaken that opponent until you beat them anyway. The rigid save system and the rubber-banding difficulty stop you from challenging yourself unless you go to the hard mode, which is often just too hard to play suboptimally. This overall hurts the game\\'s built-in replayability potential.\\nAnd replay it you should, because beyond the campaign, which took me about 12 hours going slowly and watching all the plot bits, the game currently doesn\\'t have much content. There\\'s no endgame as such, your save will just point to the final duel. There\\'s no multiplayer, though the game\\'s mechanics would support a split-screen mode very well. There are no custom games. There are only a couple mini-game \"challenges\" and a daily duel mode with a single fully configured duel where all you get to choose is your character (one of two, and it only affects your moveset in the hunting parts). The main way to get more enjoyment out of the game after first beating the campaign is to just restart it and pick different opponents when the game allows you to. The story, while a very nice addition, is mostly there to tie duels together and doesn\\'t really carry the game like its core mechanics do. In this state, the game is in my opinion not worth $20. If and when it gets a multiplayer update, I will immediately remove this review and get my friends to buy this, but as it is be prepared to get a bit less then you might expect.\\nP.S. Played with a controller. Can\\'t speak for default keyboard bindings.\\nP.P.S. Beyond the prices just being generally lower in CIS, they\\'re also not proportional to western prices. As such, in the CIS the game sits at a bit below a quarter of a AAA price, which I view as just about right for what\\'s on offer right now.',\n",

       "  'text': 'SUMMARY: It\\'s Iron Chef meets D&D in a side scrolling action puzzler RPG that you\\'re pretty much going to buy if \"Iron Chef meets D&D\" got your attention.  Fortunately it\\'s worth it as a puzzle-heavy cooking game with a light (well, kind of mediocre) set of action games.  Fun characters and a joyful spirit really bring it to life.\\nSo Battle Chef Brigade is pretty much \"hunt monsters in a simple side-scrolling action setting, then cook up the ingredients in a puzzle type game.\"  I\\'ve summed up the game in its entirety, but it doesnt quite do it justice.\\nThe core plot element of the game is simple - in a fantasy world overrun with monsters, people solved the problem by eating them.  Many chefs are now deadly ninjas, wizard, alchemists, warriors AND cooks.\\nIt\\'s when the two of these come together that the game comes to life.\\nYou  play as Mina, a young warrior-chef who spends a lot of time cooking in her family\\'s restaurant, and occasionally mass-murdering wildlife for ingredients.  She hopes to join the Battle Chef Brigade to cook unknown dishes, travel the world, and so on.  Of course nothing goes as plans, so as the plot ramps up Mina faces various challenges and hardships as dangers rear their head, monsters become aggressive, plans are afoot, AND worse of all, FOOD MAY BE RUINED.\\nThe game is two parts:\\n* You go into a side-scrolling area and beat up monsters for ingredients.  This is a simple actioner, mostly based on timing and abilities, and it can get mashy.\\n* Cooking, which is a matching puzzle, but that varies with ingredients, equipment, and other factors.  This takes some thought.\\nIn general, you go and mash monsters, then make stuff.  Sometimes you have to make multiple trips, murdering monsters while things cook in your slow cooker.  I am in no way making this up - you walk back into the kitchen with monster parts and then check on your souffle.  This is done with a total straight-facedness that is delightful.\\nIn some levels you may wander around a town, take jobs to hone your skills, and buy equipment.  These introduce you to various fun characters and wild pieces of equipment like magical pots and mysterious cookbooks.\\nAll of this is tied together with a truly interesting cast of characters, from a loveable Orc Dad cook to a cool and collected mystic - and again, with a straight face.  It feels like a playable manga or anime, down to the style and the ability to take crazy ideas and make them work.\\nIf there\\'s a flaw in the game its that some of it feels simplified or stripped-down, and I get the general sense a few things were cut.  It\\'s an ambitious endeavor, so I can see why some focus was needed.\\nWho\\'s it for:\\n* Well again if \"Iron Chef meets Fantasy\" trips your trigger you probably bought it already.\\n* If you like a fun actiony- genre fusion, you\\'ll enjoy it.\\n* If you like puzzles AND don\\'t mind some actioner, boy this has got what you need (the game could probably have left the action out).\\n* If you\\'re into trying different stylish fusions of ideas.',\n",

There weren't many unit types and it seems like there's only a few different ways to play the game. A lot of time is either a mad rush for their pig or chasing after your own. The bots varied from incompetent to incredibly difficult.\\nI didn't get a chance to check out multiplayer, but for a game this obscure, I don't think there's a lot of people playing. EDIT: I checkd out multiplayer, its just Local Area Network. Sad, because not only is that not a very common way to play any more (without special programs like Himatchi), but it means there's no ladders or neat things we see in other RTS games like Starcraft.\\nBut hey, if you wanna see all the RTS's out there, this one has a few new neat mechanics to give you some fun for a while. But if you are looking for an RTS to get serious about, I'd probably keep searching.\",\n",

Well, seeing the extended damage the plane has suffered, I’d say its more or less a crash! Gromov… Gromov… can you hear me? Incredible, the radio still works! Hello, Gromov here…\\nGoliath is an action/role playing game where you take control of Gromov, who crash landed his World War 2 plane on a mysterious planet. At the start of the game, you will have to do simple tasks: cutting trees, picking berries and setting up a camp. This is basically a tutorial and it will show you how to use both your inventory and the crafting menu to a certain aspect. After, hearing from your co-pilot which is stuck on the other side of the world, you will be shown the way to a teleporting device which stands in the middle of a specific circle (your new base). From here, you will be able to construct a laboratory, weapons and a Goliath construction. At your tent, you will be able to craft plenty of objects, but you must have the correct items to do so. I might add, you can store a good number of items in your inventory, which is great.\\nThe world itself is very interesting; it is a kind of forest with ruins of 1930 buildings here and there, futuristic fragments of spaceships, very large creatures to fight or to avoid if you do not have the right Goliath under your belt, and factions that each want to dominated this strange world. As you go along, you will meet with different characters and will be given quests to do and teleporting Gromov to different areas of the planets. What I like about the world is that each part that I have seen so far has different weather elements, deserts, snow, forests with specific plants to harvest and with different creature too. As you achieve your task, you will be given experience points. Depending on which level you have reached, you will be able to access special abilities in your Goliaths.\\nAt first, you will only be able to construct a wooden goliath, and if you have built a weapons construction table, you might be able to craft weapons for it. Then you will be able to construct stone, metal and other types of Goliaths. Each Goliath has three combat abilities, but you must reach a certain level of experience to enable each of them. To give you an example, for the wooden Goliath the first ability is available as soon as your reach level 4 of experience, then you must pass level 6 and 17 to unlock the other two. You might be able to beat a Dodo by itself quite easily but a bunch of Dodo’s are always hard to get rid of. There are a lot more creatures to fight but I will let you discover them. If you have more than one Goliath constructed, you control one and can order the other to follow you into battle or to guard an area.\\nThe combat mechanism is simple and easy to use, whether you use the mouse and keyboard or the gamepad. One thing you must collect at all costs is the gems. Every time you teleport from one part of the world to another, it will cost you a certain number of gems.\\nI really like the artwork and the controls work pretty well. One thing I noticed is that each time I load a game, the animations are not fluid for a while but then it seems to rectify itself.\\nPositives:\\n~~~~~~~\\n-\\tGood artwork\\n-\\tPlenty of quests to do\\n-\\tGood crafting mechanism\\n-\\tInteresting world\\n-\\tAchievements and Trading cards\\nNegatives:\\n~~~~~~~~\\n-\\tA bit buggy at times\\nI really enjoyed Goliath; it is a good RPG, and tell me, who would not love to build big strong robots?\\n8/10\\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

I managed to go through the first two steps of the tutorial (moving two of your units), and then the game decided I'd had enough fun, and the tutorial just stopped moving forward.\\nAlso, I can't scroll the map with my keyboard, there are no options for this, and the mouse scrolling is hopelessly sluggish, and there are no options for this either. The resolution selection option is bugged, and kept endlessly scrolling the resolutions. Also, I managed to find some kind of info screen on what the different symbols in the battle screen represented, but that was bugged as well. The symbols and the text overlapped and made it very hard to understand. That's also just what I found out with my *five* minutes with the beta patch.\\nThis was a beta patch I understand, but it's a fully released game, c'mon, it should work at some level.\\nSo yeah, haven't really played the game, if it works some day, it might be great, but I'd steer clear for now.\",\n",

You will no doubt love most, if not all of the stage and boss themes. Lastly, as with all Touhou games, only being loosely connected from game to game, with only the last few games feeling directly connected because of the fighting games that come between the main games, and the manga, you do not need to play and of the previous titles to enjoy the characters or the story, but if you want to play the previous games, just skip the sixth game, the undertale of this game series. Also, feeling the need to start from the begining will not go well without preparation, as the 1st to the 5th game require an old Japanese operating system emulator and are unable to be played on Windows, Linux or whatever operating system you use.',\n",

They are slightly on the simple side for RPGs but I never felt I lost a battle because it was impossible; I just didn\\'t figure it out yet.\\nFor the story/dialog, I\\'m happy with its length (10hr - 18hr depending on how you play).\\nThe OST is pretty great.\\nThe art direction really honed in on the 16-bit era. And really well with few exceptions. You\\'ll feel like you\\'re at your SNES most of the time playing this game.\\nWhat I didn\\'t like:\\nThe story and general dialog is not interesting or capturing. You aren\\'t going to love the protags like you love Chrono or anything. The dialog is just too much \"poke fun at 16-bit RPG games tropes\" to be exceptional. At times the dialog goes on and on and on... (no skip ability for dialog you\\'re done with).\\nThe music... great compositions. But a programmatic issue comes up with the music looping incorrectly... even after several fixes, you still aren\\'t listening to a loop. There is still a weird sound break when the (level/area/etc music) asset repeats.\\nFinal:\\nGreat game. I wish the story mattered more to me, but it didn\\'t. The game mechanics ruled.

Pixel art is great and inviting, dungeons and towns are lush with detail, combat abilities are fully animated, and the combat is intricate enough that you\\'ll have to think about how to approach every battle. There\\'s nothing like \"mash through it\" in this game, at least not until you\\'ve learned how to handle each encounter group. Puzzles and bosses are challenging enough to test you without demanding hours of attempts.\\nFew games nowadays just drop you in and say \"Okay, go\". There\\'s a thousand things to fiddle with before you can really get into the meat of the gameplay. It was very refreshing to play an entirely self-contained game that I could complete within a weekend\\'s time. Straightforwardedness is a quality that I think a lot of games have gotten away from, and it\\'s present in this game in spades.\\nThere are a few cons. There\\'s still a few bugs at time of writing, the plot and characters are somewhat on the shallow side, and the puzzle mechanics can be repetitive (as well as not really having much to do with the dungeons they reside in).\\nIf you\\'re looking for a solid weekend adventure that won\\'t consume your life then this is worth the purchase and play.

I will not re-write is as I would have to replay the game, which I won't do since my interest in it is pretty much gone. But I still recommend a purchase, now more than ever.\\nA fairly generic 2D rogelite action platformer a-la Spelunky.\\n- Bad hitstun implementation: you're sent flying in a direction after getting hit in XenonValkyrie. This has no cooldown effect and also changes the direction you're facing to the direction you're sent flying towards. Trying to engage enemies in tight quarters can lead to a situation where you land on top of the enemy, get hit and turned around, swing your sword at nothing, fall back down on the enemy, get hit again, repeating this chain until you land in a position where you can actually hit said enemy, losing a lot of health for free in the process.\\n- Foreground can get very busy: particle effects are abundant and can make the viewing experience a bit cluttered, obscuring the action at certain points in the first stage.\\n- Weapon switching is very awkward: you have two buttons to switch weapons, but the weapon wheel always moves to the left, which leads to some awkward situations where you don't know if you should press L1 or R1 to switch to the weapon you want.\\n- Wall jumping sends you back flying a set distance: trying to wall-jump into tight corridors and passages in this game can get incredibly frustrating. It always takes at least a couple of jumps too much to get anywhere when walls are involved.\\n- The area around the teleporters can get a bit busy: when you port into a new area, all the enemies around the teleporter seem to die to avoid cheap hits. However, certain enemies in this game explode upon death. The player can get caught in the blast as he leaves the teleporter and take unnecessary damage, merely by progressing the game normally.\\n- Shooting is awkward: you have to hold the attack button momentarily and then release it to shoot your gun. If you tap it too fast, nothing will happen. This is supposedly to stop you from wasting ammo but it makes actually using the guns a bit of a hassle.\\n- You can only use melee weapons during the bosses: I can understand making and balancing bosses around melee combat, but thematically, it makes no sense that the player is suddenly not able to use the rest of his arsenal, especially since the bosses are so ridiculously simple to begin with.\\nAll that being said, the game is fairly cheap and you get what you pay for.\",\n",

Sorry, GOLIATH. This will serve for a while as you are led through a fairly decently done tutorial. I quickly learned in this game that not only are there power up weapons designed for each type and style of goliath, but that there are also upgrades and new versions of each one that can be unlocked through levelling, completing specific tasks, or through the narrative of the game. The controls are basic but functional and designed to fit the game in a fairly intuitive fashion and the gameplay itself is also basic but surprisingly fun and entertaining. Coupling the crafting mechanics for creating new goliaths with a top-down shooter was actually a good match up here.\\nThe graphics are decently serviceable, but also nothing to really write home about. I do say quite often thought hat good graphics do not a great video game make. The graphics here are good enough to do what the developers were wanting to do here and it actually lends a certain basic charm to the game.\"\\nAll in all I found this game charming, well designed, and very enjoyable!

The puzzles are challenging, and interesting. It is a great hommage to the style of lovecraft stories, and very enjoyable to play. It is certainly worth playing, and I\\'m glad that I have done so. I do think it\\'s important to note this.\\nThat being said, the game is incompletable. As others has said there is a massive, leathal bug. A very large, and important cutscene, one that shapes the entire game, and gives the player direction in what to do next (as well as a huge part of the story, and reward for completing the puzzle which came before it) is missing. Also inventory issues, and not being able to access some items leaves the game incompletable from very close to the end.\\nI do understand that meridian have offered their \\'solution\\' which is to download a save game - which means still missing out on that long cutscene, as well as not completing a puzzle. Now that is no solution at all, it\\'s basically a \\'level skip cheat\\' It seems to be as though the developers really do not care about fixing this for the players.\\nIt\\'s an honest shame, because while the game is enjoyable - I would really not recommend anyone buying it. At least not until the developers actually care enough to fix this bug - and it is a bug no matter how much they want to deny that.\\ntl;dr: Don\\'t buy this game until they have fixed the MAJOR errors in it.\\nOtherwise is really is a great game.',\n",

The game removed inventory items and the alchemy kit you need to complete the game. The developers answer to everyones cries? To use a save file that skips an important piece of the game that explains the story and to finish it missing a huge chunk of the game.\\nDo yourself a favor and skip this. If you want to play this game without the developers not caring about finishing this port to Steam, go download eSPXe, set it up, download this game from coolroms, emulate it on the eSPXe PS1 emulator, and  beat it that way. It is better then buying a game where the developers can care less if it is broken/incomplete.\\nYou're welcome. Sorry devs. You done goofed. Stop using automated E-Mails next time and give a damn about the people who buy your game. A save file is not the solution to your problem. You have already shown you don't care. So be my guest and don't care.\",\n",

If you want HD graghics and intense 3D battles with fast and furious leveling and rewards this is not for you. What you do get is a challenging game with a high sense of accomplishment.\\nOther games of the time did not go into the game management required by the Realms of Arkadia. Just covering the basic needs of food and water can be difficult if you don't select the right characters and skills. You must then place points into your skills when leveling or allow the computer to do it for you but not always getting logical reulults. With improperly placed skill points some skills will never be successful.\\nNot to mention casting spells. Of the 5 different magic using types each have their own strengths and weaknesses in spell casting. If you don't plan ahead some spells will remain unavailable  or extremely difficult to cast, depending on spell strength, and Attribute score. which is also new to video games as most if not all games before simply required you to have enough spell points to successfully cast.\\nIn other words, challenges that other games did not have and alot still don't.\\nBeing able to replay a game is a major bonus as you can try different characters to receive different starting skills and spells. You can then place points differently and at the end of the game have completely different characters. Another bonus is being able to use these characters throughout the entire series of games.\\nEven if you don't like the video game you can print out the manual and sit down with friends and have a great time rolling dice and complaining how the game master hates you. Even if you do like the game it's always fun complaining how the GM hates you.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'A surrealist puzzler that\\'s a bit too easy and way too short.\\nThe surreal art is the big selling point here. There\\'s a little more to it than just that though. The controls are tight (on controller which is suggested) and the concept is simple. You need to get sleep walking Bob to bed. Bob walks in a straight line until he hits something, then he will turn 90 degrees clockwise. And repeat. You control a little weird four-legged dude thing and you run around moving an apple(s) to control where Bob goes. Get him to bed and you beat the level. Some moveable fish bridges, baddies, and drop offs will occasionally get in your way too. Its a simple concept that works in a wonderfully surreal setting.\\nI enjoyed myself but was never overly challenged. Level/puzzle design is never more than a few simple steps and always straight forward. I found myself rewarded with a speed-run achievement without even trying. Upon completing the 30 short levels you unlock \"nightmare mode\" which is the same 30 levels with keys that need to be collected by Bob before going to bed. This gave a head scratch or two but having already done the levels prior cut the problem solving in half and once again it was over before it began. Which is a shame, because the foundations for some really complex puzzles were there, but it just never happened.\\nI did have fun. But if you\\'re looking for tough puzzles look elsewhere. Heck. If you\\'re looking for medium level puzzles look elsewhere. And it cannot be understated how short it is. Easily under two hours to beat both modes with no replay-ibility. Perhaps an achievement hunter would break the two hour mark. Soft recommendation if you need a short time-killer and the art is appealing to you.',\n",

       "  'text': 'I paid $2 for Gunspell as part of a bundle, and it took me around 28 hours to finish the game once.  This is gonna be a long one, so strap in.  CTRL+F \"don\\'t recommend\" if you want to fast-forward.\\nHave you played Puzzle Quest?  This game should come off as familiar, and I\\'ll be mentioning it often enough.  Match-3 gameplay, taking turns with the enemy in order to be the last one standing, matching skulls to deal damage, matching gems to power up special attacks, getting EXP and money through matches...it\\'s familiar, but Gunspell does things kinda differently.\\nGunspell is a mobile game that was ported to Steam, and with the pricetag comes the removal of microtransactions.  You no longer can throw money at the game to get the premium currency or to restore your stamina meter.  It\\'s not entirely free of the freemium scheme, but I\\'ll touch on that later.\\nI absolutely\\nthe setting.  The Puzzle Quest series barring PQ Galactrix is set in a medieval stasis kinda world.  You know, go fight some orcs with swords and magic, maybe meet some elves, visit castles and so on.  Gunspell is set in the modern day, and while you\\'re not partying through London or Tokyo blasting demons in the face with guns, you\\'re still using a mix of high fantasy and modern gear.  You can be in a suit of knight armor and have a flamethrower to fight a kobold wearing a hockey mask, or use a giant scimitar while wearing a kevlar vest to fight a dragon, and so on.\\nI mentioned the gameplay above, but I\\'ll mention what Gunspell does differently.  There are no character classes.  You\\'re just one guy, and you have a number of stats that affect combat performance, but no stats to affect how much mana you get from gem matches--3 mana will\\nbe 3 mana, for both you and enemies.  The game board is also a hex grid as opposed to square, so you can move pieces in six directions, just like PQ Galactrix.  There are only three colors of mana; red, yellow, and blue.  You still need to gather mana, but instead of powering spells, it empowers your equipment.  All gear has passive bonuses, but some can use one color of mana to cause a specific effect, like a piece of armor using 6 yellow mana to boost your damage and restore your health.  Effects aren\\'t entirely tied to gear type, so you can honestly damage an enemy with every slot.  All without giving up your turn.\\nThere are still regular spells too, but they work like consumable items, and the enemies don\\'t get any of these.  There are four schools of spells between Attack, Defense, Buff, and Debuff, and for the most part, those give you an idea of what the spells will do.  These have a much wider variety of effects, most of which aren\\'t found on equipment.  You can deal direct damage, or damage and destroy a column or change one color of gems to another or erase coins to damage the enemy\\'s stats, among a variety of other things.  You can buy more spells at any time on the map or get them as victory spoils, but at least you can see the descriptions of everything in the shop.\\nThe story\\'s there, nothing really compelling.  Your sister\\'s gone missing and you stumble upon the world of The Order and the monsters they fight against.  Quests are largely \"go here\" or \"kill this thing\" or even \"get these items,\" but each main quest typically has some side quests.  I think there were a whole of two timed quests, so those might catch you off-guard if you activate the next main quest before quitting and one of those pop up.\\nThe music and sound didn\\'t really grab me.  In fact, the game was so loud that I ended up just muting it after a while.  There are only on/off toggles for both music and sound effects, no sliders.\\nI mentioned above that there were no microtransactions.  That\\'s true, but elements are still present.  You can\\'t buy the premium currency (gold) but you can still pay it to do things like auto-complete quests or repair your gear or refill your stamina or whatever.  You have a small chance of getting gold after each battle and some quests reward you with gold, and you also get a \"login bonus\" of it every three days.\\nThere\\'s a stamina/energy system--you know, one of those \"action X takes Y stamina, Z stamina restores every W minutes\" kinda deals, often seen in many free-to-play mobile titles.  You start with a set limit that increases when you level up, and everything from fighting monsters to moving on the map screen to refreshing the store inventory takes stamina.  You can pay gold to instantly restore when you run out, or play an honestly slow minigame, or just wait.  It makes sense for those free titles since they have to incentivize players to shell out some money to keep playing, but this is a paid title.  Why is it here?\\nEvery equippable item has a durability value.  Your gear takes damage just by bringing it into battle, instead of it taking hits from being used.  Naturally, your gear takes a bigger hit if you die wearing it.  The game at least warns you when things are almost broken, but repairing them is up to you.  You either pay a hefty sum of silver (non-premium currency) and resources, or a small fee in gold to fix it back to full.  While you get a lot of gear from fights, valid replacements for the good gear you like may not be easily-found.\\nYou start with a limited storage for gear and a separate backpack for spells, and you have to pay gold/silver and resources to unlock new slots.  You also pay one or the other to increase your spell levels to use more spells.  This isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing since it sorta acts like progression in other games, but you\\'re then stuck balancing your checkbook between fixing your gear, expanding your storage for gear and spells, and increasing your spell levels on top of buying new gear and spells.  It makes your money count, but you get resources at such a slow trickle that it really feels like grinding.\\nI had a roller coaster of a time with the difficulty.  I didn\\'t really do well until I figured out \"the trick\" using spells, but at that point I was at the end of the game and steamrolling everything I met, so maybe that\\'s how you\\'re meant to play from the start?  Otherwise I\\'d lose fights against \"weak\" opponents because they\\'d simply out-heal the damage I was dealing, or they\\'d wind up taking off a large portion of my health each turn.  Or they\\'d wind up getting a bunch of extra turns while I was powerless to stop them.\\nRNG-swinginess is something Puzzle Quest can be guilty of, but I felt it strongly here.  There are three character stats that invoke randomness in battles:  Rage which doubles dealt damage no matter its source, Block which completely nullifies one instance of damage, and Luck which gives a chance for an extra turn when making any match.  Your enemies have these stats too, of course.  Sure, the swinginess works both ways, but it just makes battles annoyingly random, unless you spam spells to make fights effortless.\\nBut even if I liked parts of the game, I don\\'t recommend Gunspell.  I mean, you\\'re paying $15 for a game that tells you when you\\'ve had enough, for God\\'s sake!  And you\\'re paying $15 for just the first part of the game with no indication if the next part will be a free patch, DLC, or an entirely new library entry (if it ever comes).  I didn\\'t play much of the actual free version, but this feels like they just changed how to get the premium currency and nothing else.  You still have to wade through the free-to-play nonsense to get at what\\'s here.  If you wanna check it out, try it on mobile, but don\\'t pay full price for this.  It\\'ll likely be bundle fodder for years to come, so you can probably pick it up on the cheap.  But if you\\'re looking for a match-3 RPG, I\\'d suggest you start elsewhere.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Lost Marbles is a great idea that is executed poorly. The core concept is clever; different marbles made out of different materials, being able to do different things in order to get all the marbles to the end of the level. Simple, all well and good. The problem is that it\\'s a 3D platformer, and in the end, it doesn\\'t realise the problems that 3D platformers face, meaning that it falls into a feeling of randomness in terms of its gameplay.\\nIn several sections of the game, I died more times than I felt like I should have simply because I slid off a platform, or because I didn\\'t get a feeling for the depth between two platforms (and the platforms aren\\'t designed for the marble\\'s maximum jump distance; meaning you can jump past the platform, which is infuriating in a 3D platformer where depth perception is an issue), or I didn\\'t catch enough speed to get across a gap that I couldn\\'t judge the width of. There were many parts in the game where it felt like you had to fight against the mechanics instead of working with them, simply because of the level design not being balanced fully around the \"powers\" that the marbles have at times. When the game itself is stripped down in the way that Lost Marbles is, where the mechanics and level design is all there is, and those then feel amateurish and mediocre at best... then the game is majorly flawed.\\nHonestly, this game is not worth the money or time. As someone who do seek to finish all games to the end, I couldn\\'t even bother to do that with this game, despite it being so short. The game does function, at times it\\'s even fun to play; but the flaws do weigh down the good parts, and in between the good and the bad the game is just... dull. In the end, there are a lot of games out there that have way better execution that this one, and you should probably skip over Lost Marbles.',\n",

       "  'text': 'I really loved the first Costume Quest because it was simple yet fun. It had a lot of atmosphere, a cute humor and was just generally loveable.\\nCostume Quest 2 kept some of those aspects, like the free roaming in small areas, where you can do some fun side quests and the tongue-in-cheek dialogues. However, that\\'s pretty much it.\\nThe best way to describe this sequel is \"frustrating and dull\". The game loves to play with the players patience. That starts with the fact that everytime you want to access the main menu, you\\'ll have to go through credits and an animation and continues when you can\\'t skip a cutscene.\\nThe worst offender however is the new fighting system. First of all, all the costumes play the same (and you need much longer to acquire new ones). Even the small variation when it comes to how to execute an attack was taken out of the game. That makes the fights pretty stale, you ALWAYS press the same buttons. Apart from that, the new technique in which you initate your attacks feels weird - it\\'s hard to understand how to actually execute \"amazing\" attacks.\\nThe Halloween-card system was changed aswell. Instead of giving each of your character either an additonal attack or a cool passive, you can only use those cards once. That brings some more variation to the fights, but makes the cards less reliable aswell.\\nThen, there is this stupid new well-system, which forces you to refill your health after each fight. If you don\\'t do that, your characters will have decreased health the next time you get into a fight - UNLESS they died in the last battle. So you\\'re pretty much punished for surviving fights. This can be super frustrating when you enter a bossfight with a big disadvantage, lose and then have to watch the whole cutscene again (cause you can\\'t skip it).\\nThe level-design isn\\'t very exciting aswell. Thinking of the great Grubbins On Ice DLC for CQ1, that brought some variation to the areas, Costume Quest 2 feels like a rehash of the first game with muddy textures. The side-quest are pretty much the same ones aswell.\\nin conclusion, the sequel does not do justice to the first game and comes across pretty lackluster. Neither the story nor the gameplay are actually engaging and most of the \"improvements\" feel gimmick-y.',\n",

First of all how strong you are is compared to the equipment you have on and you dont really pick out your spells they are attatched to your equipment so theres no real customisation; the only spells you can chose cost cash each time you cast them which can get expensive and you cant always find them.  One thing ive noticed that happens is the computer suggests a move to you after awhile if you havent moved that will set the enemy up for sucess; ive tested it out afew times by skipping my turn and intuitively knowing what their next move will be.  I like the touch of having to repair your equipment though its WAY too expensive to do it so when your item breaks you might as well toss it to the curb.  In short it tries to be a puzzle RPG but without any real leveling up benefits other than just increased health and frustrating combat puzzling.',\n",

       "  'text': 'I do not recommend this game unless it is discounted to a large extent or comes in a bundle (which happens often recently).\\nThe time length for finishing the game is about 16.5 hours for me. At first, the game experience was good, as I have been addictive to the 3-match/RPG hybrid genre ever since Puzzle Quest, and this game offers similar elements such as various items, spells and enemies. However, after the first 3-5 hourse, the game became pure grinding.\\nThis game is a mobile port, with microtransactions originally, and fortunately the developer stated that they have removed the microtransactions and re-balanced the mechanism therefore. The fact is, they did the removal and the corresponding modifications, but it can be hardly called \"balanced\". You still get too little stamina (used for all your actions in the game) from playing the minigame and too few golden coins from defeating the enemeis (the dropping rate of one single golden coin for one single battle is basically 35%, and you need hundreds of them to buy items, upgrade equipment, and unlock item, spell and storage slots).\\nThe items and spells function well and are interesting except that 95% of the items from loot or shops are craps. The item sets refering to other games (Metro, Fallout, etc.) are interesting ideas and worth collecting considering the bonus provided.\\nMany players complain that the game was too easy. That\\'s true. A few disagree and say that the real challange begins at around level 6. That\\'s also true, partially. When you save enough money to buy the right weapon, the combat returns to the one-or-two-skull-matches-kill-the-enemy pattern until the appearance of dragons.\\nThe battlefield, events, missions, enemies lack variation. They just stay in the same way as you see from the very first map, except changes in numeral values. Since the story is practically nothing, the game quickly become quite repetitive. The whole play through felt like the game is forcedly extended to ten times longer than it normally should be.\\nIn summary, this game is definitely inferior to Puzzle Quest 1, but comparable to Puzzle Quest 2, and I may only recommend it to those who is very addictive to this kind of games and have 1-2 free hours to kill every day.',\n",

There are some puzzle minigames that help develop your abilities for the cookoffs, and for the most part the difficulty is fair. I'm not much of a multiplayer person (IE, I don't like playing multiplayer at all), but this game does seem like it would be built to have a multiplayer component with the cookoffs, but somehow doesn't. That's a lack that probably most people will feel.\\nWorth 20$? No, not at all. Closer to 10$. Even then, maybe on a sale.

There's only one thing that I struggle to get used to, and that is how the marbles decelerate when I stop moving. They come to a stop much quicker than I expect, as I'm used to something similar to how marbles slow down in real life, so that's just something that I need to get used to.\\nOne thing about this game that sort of left me unsatisfied me was the death animations. I expected that if I rolled a paper ball into fire, it would burn, and if I ran a rubber ball over some spikes, that the ball would pop, but instead, the ball just disappears, and a ghost-like skull just floats above it, and that just kind of seems lazy.\\nOther than that, the nature of the puzzles feels nice and smooth, and I do like hopping on and playing a quick permadeath on it, so I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a quick 3D puzzler.\\nI rate this game:\\nA nice little lego set/10\",\n",

So you should be able to complete the game in a short amount of time. It has potential to be added to if the developer decides to do that.

I find this somewhat weird, since I have never associated apples with time manipulation.

       "  'text': \"Battle Chef Brigade is an immensely enjoyable mash up between a brawler and a match-3 puzzle game, set in a world where people have learned to hunt and cook the monsters inhabiting their lands.\\nThe gameplay itself revolves outside of the story bits mostly around a series of cooking duels, which are broken down into a hunt for ingredients (mostly parts gathered from defeated monsters) and the cooking of said ingredients to produce a delicious meal for the judges. The hunting is done in a brawler-style fighting system and the cooking is visualized through the aforementioned match-3 puzzle system.\\nThe art style of the game is very colourful and sprightly and the animations of the various characters / monsters while occasionally feeling a bit sparse, are generally very well drawn and sometimes even good for a chuckle. The voices of the various characters are also quite well done; I especially liked whoever is doing the voice of Pontida, the main area's restaurant proprietor, which had a very charming accent.\\nAll in all I would definitely recommend Battle Chef Brigade to anyone who is either a fan of brawlers, match-3 games or just likes the premise of the game as described above. I for one certainly have enjoyed my time with this game very much and it's not often that I find myself starting another run on a higher difficulty setting after completing a game, yet Battle Chef Brigade motivated me to do so immediately. Here's hoping we may eventually get another installment in this franchise, I would certainly love to see more of this game.\",\n",

Although not quite as nuanced as those of Stardew Valley or On the Rain Slick Precipice of Darkness episodes 3 and 4, the combat and stat systems are fresh and engaging.  Boss encounters are well designed, and there is a definite underlying theme which unifies the tactical combat with the plot of the game.  The sound and music are particularly well done, and the game features a couple of the cleverest interactive flashbacks (a JRPG staple) in the genre.

       "  'text': 'While Touhou 16 (東方天空璋 ～ Hidden Star in Four Seasons), the first of the series to come to Steam despite being the 25th currently released entry to the Touhou Project series, is not my favorite game title of the series, but is part of one of my favorite game series of all time. It\\'s not for everyone, so this review is targeted for those jumping into the world of Gensokyo for the very first time.\\nFirst of all, let me say that if you are trying this game for the first time, play the game on Easy. This is not one of those games that\\'s beginner friendly on Normal, and the Easy difficult is\\nfor people who have never played a Shoot \\'em Up (shump) genre game before, and even if you have, Touhou\\'s different enough from the genre to warrant an Easy playthrough to see what you\\'re getting into. To put it as the YouTuber NakaTeeleli did: \"Easy is hard, Normal is really freaking hard, Hard is tearing-your-hair-out hard, and Lunatic is... actually quite fitting.\" This is essentially Touhou in a nutshell for many beginners.\\nThere is a dedicated English patching program out there found\\nand it\\'s what I will be judging the dialogue of the game on (also good to read the in-game manual with). Simply put, the genre of the game makes dialogue and story really simple and straight-forward, sometimes leaving meanfulness behind. Even with the four different characters to choose from, dialogue is quick, straight forward, frank, and even blunt at times. The game has a story prologue found in the physical manual of the game, but is translated\\n, and gives some intro insight into the game\\'s story proper if you get into it English patched so you aren\\'t totally lost in the narative.\\nThose four characters to choose from are based on the various seasons, and each character has their own choice of four sub-shot types also based on seasons. This gives the game variety in shot types, but as many who play this game can tell you, certain combos are better than others, so a good way to get a feel for each shot type is to play each character with their sub-shot matching their respective season. Gameplay basically consists of many mostly slow projectiles attacks (referred to in the series as \"danmaku\") woven in intricate patterns requiring players to dodge in a various manor of ways with some being static patterns, projectiles aimed at your position, or a mixture of both. In-game, your player character\\'s hitbox (shown by pressing Shift if you\\'re using keyboard controls) must not get hit by the danmaku projectiles or you will lose a life.\\nDifficulty curbes in the later half of the six stages outside of the unlockable Extra Stage which is unlocked upon a full clear of those stages. In-game, you start with a set of two lives (represented by hearts, more gained by scoring at values under the hearts), three bombs (represented by stars), 1.00 Power (maxes at 4.00 w/ \"P\" items), 10,000 point\\'s score value (represented as \"点\" items), and the last value being \"Graze\" which increases when a danmaku projectile passes close by your character (having more multiplies score the more you graze). The goal the game sets is for players to clear the game without running out of all your lives by the end of stage six. While you can continue after a game over, which is highly recommended for practice, beating the game under a continue results in a Bad Ending, so the goal is to get the Good Ending across the multiple difficulties. Don\\'t expect to beat the game your first try difficulty go because a lot of the game has pattern memorization that\\'s really needed for some attacks, so make use of those Practice and Spell Practice modes; they\\'re a\\nin overcoming some of the difficult hurdles every player faces. Easy to understand as this is, this game is still very difficult, and I mean\\ndifficult. It may take you years of practice to reach a high difficulty levels. For some folks this kind of struggle isn\\'t worth it, but for others, myself included, getting to that level of skill is one of the most thrilling/rewarding/gratifying gaming experiences out there today. It is for this reason I highly recommend playing the Touhou Project series, more than just this game too; there are entries out there, and all have their own mechanics, quirks, and charms!\\nTo close this review piece, one of the major things to note about this game is the music. While many will say with good reason that\\nthe games, even the first five games back in the NEC PC-9801 system have great music, this game\\'s score in particular is considered exceptionally great, and a wonderful listening experience (even as I write this review, I\\'m listening to music in the in-game music room!). Touhou is the kind of game with such memorable music. It\\'s spawned a phenomenon in game music alone with millions of fan arrangements. The music of the original games is still music that has such a stand-out unique style to it, and is brilliantly composed. Even if the game isn\\'t for you, it\\'s very worth your time to hear the soundtrack to this game and the rest of the series. Seriously,\\nI very highly recommend playing the Touhou Project series if it\\'s your cup of tea. You can actually buy a physically copy of the game also, but if you buy it on Steam, it\\'s more direct support to the series\\' creator Jun\\'ya Ota (who goes by the pseudonym ＺＵＮ). This series is not only prolific with plenty of games to its name, but the mainline series of shump games are made exclusively by ZUN; he acts as a one-man team which gives these game a true charm for they are games he wanted to truly make. The series has also a fair share of fighting games if you\\'re a fan of those games handled by Twilight Frontier, too (東方憑依華\\u3000～ Antinomy of Common Flowers by them is coming to Steam too!). The creator has inspired so many where he not only made the game\\'s engine and programming by himself from scratch, but also composed, drew, wrote, and tested (sometimes with help) the games he made all by himself. He\\'s also a successful story writer who has written one fiction novel, nine amazing official comics spanning of four series, two short stories and comics (as bonus material to his works) and 6 artbooks. While all the art in this literature from artists brough on to help (two of which have their art featured in official games). The fact that ZUN\\'s influence has allowed for artist to speak their wonderful personal stories of working with ZUN and how great it is to work with him, it speaks\\non the influence ZUN has had on people with his series.\\nZUN\\'s works has changed lives and inspired countless fan contributed work all of which ZUN allows under his series\\'\\n). He helped popular fan games come to consoles like the Playstation 4 and the Nintendo Switch, and set wonderful attitude towards fan works that game designers of today should absolutely take notes on. The Touhou Project is more than just a game series folks, it is a varitable phenomenon the likes of which this review will never do full justice.\\nWith that all said, I hope you enjoy Touhou. Its creator is my personal hero, and I\\'d like to thank him, the people that work with him, the fans that asked Touhou to come to Steam, for the success this game alone has had on Steam, the Touhou Patchers who keep releasing English patches to enjoy, the Touhou Wiki (that I linked to) for being such a fantastic resource for all information Touhou, a good friend who helped me proofread this review, and to the fellow fans who enjoy Touhou with me.\\nThank you in advance for the reading my first review, folks! Have fun playing Touhou! ^^',\n",

       "  'text': 'Battle of the Bulge is a strategy game quite similar to Risk (the boardgame) in a sense. Removing the luck factor, the player must move armies across the map and capture territories in order to fulfill certain objectives. You can\\'t produce your own units, but every other turn or so each side might get reinforcements depending on the scenario. Thus, the game offers limited resources for each \"mission\", but this forces the player to come up with creative and meaningful decisions in order to succeed, as opposed to massing an immense number of units and crushing the AI through sheer force of numbers.\\nThis is a very good game for a company\\'s first title. While the prime concepts of gameplay are rather easy to understand, there is enough depth to the game that it never feels stale: Battle of the Bulge falls into the easy to learn - difficult to master category. Thankfully, the AI is challenging enough, so the player must put in the effort and think for himself. It is definitely worth its price and can prove to be a gripping title if you are one to enjoy slow, turn-based strategical thinking.\\nI whole-heartedly recommend this game.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Alright..  after owning this game since launch and still putting up with it, I say it\\'s time I explained my personal opinions on Lost Marbles.  Starting with the Pros:\\nThe concept is amazing and works really well..  Most of the time.\\nThe music is soothing, fitting for a puzzle game\\nControls are stiff and responsive, giving you time to react to mistakes if you arn\\'t at an edge\\nQuite cheap for a nice Indie game\\nCool looking skins\\nBut the main cons of this game bring those down to no end, starting with:\\nTerrible level design.  Despite what Nerdcubed said about this game when he demoed it for us on his channel before launch, most of the levels during the third and fourth part feel needlessly frustrating up to borderline impossible (Metal Before it was Cool is a prime example)  and brings down this game so much.\\nMost of the mechanics in levels are done poorly to terribly, the teleporters and fans taking big notes for this alongside the terrible buckets that throw you out with ease\\nLength, on launch this game had three areas with thirty levels total, now there are...  Four areas with fourty.  The reason..  Well..\\nBinary Takeover himself, nothing against the guy, but on the main menu, from over a year ago he revealed he went to work on a new game called Drunk Simulator 2015.\\nYou heard me, a game that could have been an amazingly well made colorful adventure with a constant fanbase to back from the Nerdcubed hype, became a forgotten title for the creator to join the joke \"Simulator\" storm of games. The hilarious part is, Drunk Simulator 2015 was put on the Google Play store.  So any steam fans were completley ripped off, well done man, well done..\\nWith that I had no choice but to say that Lost Marbles fails on it\\'s biggest selling points, and left people like myself disheartened and ripped off.',\n",

The whole game is beautifully hand drawn.\\nthe bad:\\n1. The controls are wierd and unintuitive (cant rebind them afaik).\\n2. The game is fairly short (9-10 hours).\\n3. The combat can feel pretty bad at times.\\nIts flaws are mostly from a lack of polish, but if you can look past them you'll have a really fun time on your hands.

It does have a daily cook-off challenge if you want to do those, but it feels like it lacks the same tension as the story battles.\\nTl;dr: Fun game that is worth it at full price even if its a bit short.

I knew we were in for a treat with the mighty Lun onboard mapping and setting up the story, but the whole package turned out to be incredible - from the sublime soundtrack to the frustrating-yet-satisfying-when-you-finally-crack them puzzles, the world design was brilliant too -- though sadly not quite as expansive as I\\'d have liked, which I guess is my way of saying \"I wanted more! MORE!\" :D With the current industry trend towards more action-based combat systems and less turn-based, this was a delightful return to strategic form. Combat wasn\\'t grindy in the slightest, and required some true thought into exploiting enemy weaknesses. Visuals were cutesy SD but impressively animated and plenty of areas were unique and deliciously drawn in gorgeous pixel art -- and the overall game really brought back some memories of the much maligned, yet a true guilty pleasure, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.\\nIf I had to talk about negative aspects, the aforementioned puzzles spring to mind. Unfortunately the only puzzles in the game were classic \"sliding block\" puzzles... and there were a lot of them, some more infuriating than others, but still more than I\\'m usually comfortable with. Sadly the story, whilst certainly passable, never really expanded beyond \"leave village, find father\" and while there were some twists and turns, it was largely by the numbers. Something of a slight disappointment for a game that evokes memories, both in gameplay, style, and audio, of the mighty forebears like FFVI. A lack of logbook and/or world map unfortunately makes endgame exploration more tedious than it should be, but that was a sign of the times of the era this game so faithfully recreated :)\\nIn the end, for the low price you pay for this, you really can\\'t go wrong. It\\'s a delight to play, sounds great, has gorgeous reto styled SNES-era visuals, and will easily set you back a good 15-20 hours. Truly recommended to anyone that has a soft spot for classic SNES-era jRPGs <3',\n",

       "  'text': 'A great tribute to the old school 8 and 16 bit JRPGs!  It\\'s exactly what you\\'d expect: plucky group of young adventures, quirky dialog, villainous princes and of course a quest to save the world.  As is traditional, it mostly linear until the end when you get full freedom to explore the world and find side quests.\\nPlus there\\'s some nice improvements over the standard JRPGs of the 16 bit era:\\n- No random fights: all the monsters appear on the map, so you\\'ll know when you\\'re getting into a fight.  They stay dead until you leave the dungeon, which is nice when you\\'re exploring\\n- The AP system: AP is used for all characters special actions (special attacks, spells, etc).  You regenerate AP every round of combat, so you can actually let loose with those special abilities rather than saving them for the boss fight.\\n- Fights are tough: because of the AP system, they expect you to be using your special abilities or you won\\'t win.  Very few battles are just choosing \"fight\" for all 4 characters.\\n- Save anywhere: Yup, no save points.  Well, actually they have \"save points\" but they are actually just full HP/AP restore.  Bonus: the save points talk back to you!\\nA few cons:\\n- The game is short: probably 10-16 hours (depends on how many of the side quests you choose to do at the end).  Not bad at all for the price, but not quite the typical 40 hours one might expect from a JRPG\\n- Not much in the way of character customization until the very end.  For most of the game, there\\'s only one obvious weapon/sword/accessory to equip on each character.  It\\'s only at the end that you\\'ll finally have some choices in how you\\'d like to spec your party.\\nTL:DR: If you love old-school JRPGs, you\\'ll love this.  Buy it!',\n",

       "  'text': \"I love hex-and-counter tabletop wargames, but I'm often disappointed by their digital cousins. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that John Butterfield has created an absolute gem of a game that really combines the best of both worlds.\\nBattle of the Bulge plays exactly like a tabletop game, only better. It has the simplicity of form that is such an important part of the appeal of tabletop wargames, and which is also the key to their success as historical simulations. Battle of the Bulge takes a solid wargame design in this tradition, and adds just enough digital bells and whistles. The random number of turns in each game day is a particularly neat aspect of the design.\\nI do have a few criticisms.\\nThe game shows its origins as an iOS port. There are no tooltips or hotkeys, which would really speed up play. There are also some graphics issues. Although the game looks great in general, it can be tricky to make sense of the terrain without zooming all the way in. Bridges and towns in particular are easy to miss. It should be possible to select groups of units; moving three units down a road together shouldn't take seven clicks.\\nInformation isn't always presented in the most helpful fashion. There's no reason for battle pop-ups not to be expanded by default, and without tooltips there's no easy way to check which combat modifiers will apply except for moving units into a space and then undoing. I had to play a few games before I really understood how reinforcements arrive. Some kind of reminder on the main screen of where reinforcements are inbound and what special rules are in effect would be a huge improvement.\\nThe AI is fine, but could use refinement. I didn't notice big differences between the commanders, and after a few games you'll be stomping them flat anyways. The AI does have an annoying tendency to abandon important spaces; I've frequently seen it vacate Liege to disastrous effect. Multiplayer is where a game like this really shines anyways.\\nThere's also a whole kampfgruppe of obnoxious bugs on the loose, but I'm trusting that they'll be destroyed by superior developer airpower once the weather clears.\\nThis is a fabulous game and I can't wait for the next installment in the series, one of which is designed by my very favorite game designer Ted Racier. (Hey, Ted! How about a digital version of Case Yellow, 1940?) I hope that other wargame designers will take notice of Battle of the Bulge and try something similar. This really could be the future of wargaming.\",\n",

It is a metroidvania / roguelike platformer with perma-death.\\nThere is a decent backstory, and you get thrust into the action fairly quickly. Players will be given a choice between 3 different characters with unique skills and attributes, as they traverse through randomly generated space zones.\\nLearning curve is easy and the game is pretty straightforward. With the randomised factors, there are many different ways and paths that you can take to reach the end of each zone. Each zone will consist of a variety of monsters, random power-ups(weapons) and unique bosses. There is also an exp-table which allow your characters to level up, making them stronger and faster. After the end of each zone, you get to interact with NPCs, either for shops or hidden quests/additional backstories.\\nDo take note, even though the learning curve is easy, this game's difficulty is very unforgiving. A small mistake will cost you greatly, but it also adds to the fun and challenge.\\n+++ The Good +++\\n1) Beautiful backgrounds, pixel graphics, unique monster/bosses/character art.\\n2) Fantastic retro chiptune music, goes along well with the flow of the game.\\n3) There is alot of replayability with the various classes and the randomisation factors.\\n4) RPG style, character progression with level-ups, weapons.\\n5) Developer is very active, and open to suggestions and feedback. Plenty of bug fixes.\\n6) Different endings based on your choices, there are also secrets involved !\\n--- The Bad ---\\n1) Difficulty is high, game is pretty unforgiving with permadeath. There can be frustration over small simple mistakes.\\n2) Keyboard controls can be a bit clunky, would be easier if you have a controller.\\n3) Minor translation issues, not game-breaking, but it can be annoying to certain players. (Do take note developer's main language is not english)\\nOverall, this game impressed me with its features. The gameplay is very challenging and fun, with great art/music mixed in. The developer is also very active and receptive to constructive feedback, which is a huge plus.\\nI would say this game appeals more to metroidvania/platformer fans, who fancy a challenge. It might be slightly frustrating at the start, but once you get passed that phase, you will really enjoy the game!\\nFinal Score : 8.5 / 10\",\n",

It provides some arcadey fun and pulls off that loop of playing, dying,  and saying \"one more time\". i.e. keeping you engaged for a half hour, 45 min, an hour, etc. when you have a good run going.\\nIt reminds me of Cave Story a bit, but with a *tad* less finesse than that game\\'s character feel. Initially, it was much more rigid, but thanks to an update in March, its been made MUCH more fluid. Everyone controls a lot better now - its a major improvement to the core character controller, and even things like switching weapons has been tightened up, becoming faster and more responsive. Overall the action feels good, but is a little more methodical than you might expect - which may not be coming through from the trailers or screenshots. Its got its own flow and tempo, but what its going for definitely works well.\\n>>>>March update: I should also mention that this March update (ver. 1.1.0) has also just improved a bunch of things, including the front end. It feels a whole bunch more \"finished\" now in general - it features a proper opening, there\\'s more \"proper\" presentation all around now with better title cards upon entering stages and stuff like that. Most importantly, there\\'s now options to fiddle with including fundamental things like fullscreen or windowed :D This game is feeling much better and super polished now!<<<<\\n\\nThere\\'s obviously some issues. Some graphic tiles used may double as backgrounds and collision. Some traps (gas spewers) only trigger when you\\'re onscreen, throwing off their pattern. The reach on some of your melee weapons are total garbage, and some enemies seem practically untouchable as a result. The algorithm used to generate levels certainly isn\\'t perfect, as expected, but it puts out good stuff more often than not.\\n\\nI wish it looked better, at least its characters. Its got a good STYLE, and the backgrounds are actually pretty nice, resembling a chunkier, lower-res Super Metroid or Metroid Fusion. The characters stand out A TON though, because they\\'re only like 10 large, chunky pixels arranged together, unfortunately. They successfully capture ZERO PERCENT of the cool designs from the key art you\\'re seeing on the store page, which is a total shame. If the backgrounds were higher-res, and the character sprites shot for a style at least more like a Drill Dozer, Shockman or MetaGal instead, this would all be so much improved (it would probably be able to hang with something like TimeSpinner then).\\nIt is what it is, and while I personally think it all comes off looking a bit too much like \"Super Metroid for Atari\", the execution on the visual presentation is fine overall. Some nice chiptunes here as well.\\n\\nI actually can\\'t speak as to how this compares with Rogue Legacy, 20XX, Spelunky or the other big Roguelikes (I gotta start playing more of these), but I know that I\\'ve enjoyed playing this so far. Its got a few quibbles, but generally comes together well, and its a game I\\'m coming back to when I want to just zone out, listen to a podcast, and play something for a little bit of time.

If you just want trading cards and achievements on your Steam profile, then this game will certainly help you accomplish this in about an hour (it's SUPER easy to do).\\nAssuming that you're the patient, honest, and nerdy kind, then yep - this game is incredibly cheap and worth your 30 minutes or so. It's pretty good for someone learning or brushing up on some high school math. The puzzles get more challenging as the stages progress. Grab it on special if you have a few cents to spare but don't expect tutorial stages or explanations to help you learn the math (especially for the more difficult problems).\",\n",

       "  'text': '\"Well, I\\'m glad I kickstartered this.\" isn\\'t something I get to say often enough with a videogame. But I get to say it this time!\\nBattle Chef Brigade is very much more than the sum of its parts. Mainly combining match-3 puzzling with brawler platforming, BCB is clearly somewhat inspired by the cooking and alchemy sections of the PS2 game Odin Sphere, but... with a much tighter focus. Consisting largely of a linear series of cooking battles, you go out and slay monsters to collect their drops, which then become match-3 game pieces to use in the kitchen. The goal is to satisfy judges who prefer a particular ingredient type and color, though you can collect various other scoring goals based on cookbooks you unlock. There are two characters with their own techniques - Mina and Thrash - but you\\'ll be playing Mina for the most part. There are also fixed match-3 puzzle segments, hunting levels where you\\'re just assigned X monsters to defeat, and speed puzzling where you have to create certain color combos. There\\'s special moves to unlock, and a limited number of slots for upgrades means you\\'re forced to focus on a particular strategy or playstyle instead of just getting flatly better.\\nIndividually some of these segments would be weak, but BCB is changing gears often enough that it\\'s hardly a concern, since you\\'re rarely focusing on any one particular segment. The 2D sprites and music are well-done, though the animation is more than a little lacking at points. While you\\'re not likely to notice in the frantic cooking battles, it becomes startlingly obvious outside of them. While the voicework is generally strong, there are a few voices that sound more amateurish... though, once again, the game is often switching gears often enough that it\\'s hard to dwell too long on the flaws. While the story is middling, the characters really do bring it to life, and I\\'d love to see more with this particular cast in a more engaging tale.\\nLargely, it feels like a great start and proof of concept, and I\\'d love to see the team get a sequel to flesh it out more. While it\\'s obviously limited by its budget and scope, there\\'s something special and fresh here - no pun intended - but once you\\'re done with the story, there isn\\'t too much else to explore. I\\'m glad to see the ambitious notion of \"fantasy Iron Chef\" worked out better than I might have even expected, and it\\'s a good fun romp for awhile even if it sadly doesn\\'t last. Still, if the idea appeals to you, this is definitely worth a try.\\nCompleted the story mode and was a kickstarter backer, as already mentioned.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The first time I saw this game was at my cousin\\'s house, when I was very young. I remember seeing only a few scenes and considered it to be a very difficult game.\\nI imagined it to be Flashback until recently, when I found it again on Steam.  =}\\nI didn´t play much the classic at that time, so I don´t have any pattern for comparison. My opinions are shaped exclusively by this recent experience. Just finished the game ... The game is short, but I played for short periods at a time. I probably finished the game in 3 or 4 sessions.\\nBoy .. This game is good ... Very good .. Overwhelming good! This is one of those games that, as soon as it finished, left me with a feeling of wanting to play it again! So Sad!!\\nWhy is it so good? Even for today standards? I\\'ll try to explain why I felt like that:\\nNo matter the graphics of this game, controls, gameplay, not even sound effects and music. It also doesn´t need modern strategies that appeal to the psychological and our brain mechanisms related to personal success, collecting, fulfillment of goals that can be visualized or are showed to us, power and influence, achievements, and so on.\\nIt is able to provide a complete entertainment session by his own fantasy, game evolution, difficulty, possibility of imagination.\\nAdventure/Action/Platformer. A science fiction story that evolves quickly, by different scenarios, different intensities, so that the player, once immersed, must go throughout the story that doesn´t become boring. All the time unexpected and unconventional events are presented. Moreover, even with the primitive gameplay, dozens of different mechanics are explored, so the player will always be experimenting with something new and creative.\\nThe only factor that can make you give up the game at that moment and come back later is the difficulty. The gameplay is based on learning to make movements absolutely accurate for that occasion. The player needs to learn how to deal with that \"screen\", which once mastered becomes easy. This learning actually becomes one more factor that makes the game enjoyable to progress, providing some value to those times of overcoming.\\nAfter the intensity of the final scenes, this overcoming of both the characters during the escape and the player after the countless deaths, will make you enjoy the game even more.\\nI would not know if it was intentional or not, but in every attempt, the player is constantly in tension to try to avoid the numerous fatalities, focused on doing everything perfectly as he has learned from the game itself, that this dosage is the right measure for the player not to be bored in the position of \"observer\" and to empathize to the drama of the characters and evolution of the story.\\nThis game doesn´t have a single speech (other than Mycaruba!). But it\\'s a book with visuals and sounds. It\\'s an interactive movie with rewards for your determination. It\\'s an old game, but if it had been released this year. It would remain great.\\nWe need more of these short intense creative adventures with such great stories.',\n",

I enjoy solving obscure puzzles and thinking about the game for hours and hours.. i had to use UHS walkthrough and eventually youtube videos just to get to the part of the game where... uh.. you CAN\\'T FINISH IT.\\nSo don\\'t waste your money. Its a pity b/c there is a real potential here, if you could acutally finish the game, and the cutscenes were put back in it would be \"ok\".\\nI hope this helps.',\n",

However, there are some details which are harder to get from the beginning (like how supplies work, isolated units, attacking a forrest tile etc), which I think give the game some extra depth.

Buggy collision detection with bosses, enemies constantly fall into enemy pits, lack of ability to shoot up/down means you can\\'t do anything when they do. The physics on grenades is bad, with them often clipping through ceilings and shooting upward into the sky. You have to utilize bombs constantly to progress through levels. The amount of bugs combined with the daily updates pretty much spells it out: This is not a finished game.\\nI\\'m not a big fan of this graphical style, and while the backgrounds pull it off, the sprites look quite bland, and often it can be hard to tell what kind of environmental tile is a solid foreground tile, a passable background tile, or a drop-down foreground tile. Admittedly this doesn\\'t take long to figure out, but it\\'s something that should be obvious from the get-go.\\nFinally, the interface and controls leave a lot to be desired, my primary grievance being the cumbersome weapon switching system. On top of that there\\'s no explanation for how anything works.\\nThis game doesn\\'t really offer much that spelunky doesn\\'t, and lacks a lot of what spelunky has. The only strong point I found in this game is it seems to have a better variety of weapons. I could maybe recommend it to an anime weeb looking for that anime spelunky to fill that... oddly specific anime spelunky niche, but there\\'s not really much anime to be seen, with the player sprite and most sprites being 8x8 at just enough detail to get kind of an idea of what they are, artstyle really does not matter.\\nThis is the second game I\\'ve bought from this developer, and while to its credit I don\\'t feel like I\\'m going to be refunding this one, I don\\'t think I\\'m going to buy their next one either.

       "  'text': 'Source Filmmaker is personally one of my preferences when it comes down to animation. I would recommend this to anyone at the beginning stages of animation.\\nSource Filmmaker, in my opinion, is a great software for beginners, as it provides several different ways of animating for people so they can find what motion suits them best. The tools also start off simple to use, and can help teach you how a certian tool works. Each tool also provides more complex features, so your animation can result in smoother, and in a realistic style.\\nThis software is widely recommended to people interested in animation, and are only beginners. The software comes with free, pre-made models from TF2, and Half-Life. Get creative, inovate, and see what you can do with Source Filmmaker.\\n(Please note, I am not a professianal at animation or film-making, I am recemmending this software to anyone interested in animation and needs a place to start. From my experience, this software is the best animation program you can possibly find out there. Thanks.)',\n",

The background, the towns, and even the enemies are simply hard to put into words, in a good way. All I can absolutely say with the art is that it is breathtaking as to how the art is displayed within the game.\\nStory: The concept and lore of the story are interesting, but the characters themselves aren't. To avoid spoilers, majority of the character development is reliant on flashbacks and there's very little focus on the characters themselves. I really feel that the devs should emphasize more present dialogue to further flesh out the characters.\\nCombat system and gameplay elements: I really adore the combat system because it is strategic in its own nature that certain moves are more important than others, but all skills can still be used until the end. The pacing and difficulty is right on point as there's really no point of grinding for extra levels, so you never feel that you should backtrack for levels. The puzzles in this game are interesting and innovative, but they become repetitive as you progress in the game.\\nPersonally, I would rate this game 7.5/10. If you really like the aesthetics of the game with good OST, an interesting story, and a strategic combat system, I recommend getting this game.\",\n",

One long part of the game actually has you looking through a library for books. Seriously, what could be more boring than looking through a library for books... on a computer game? Who in the world thought that would be a good idea? Then right at the end there was a flaw in my inventory that prevented me from going any further, so that much of my effort was ultimately wasted. Instead I watched the end of it on youtube, and really, the end is just awful. You may as well have the main character wake up and \"it was all just a dream.\" It\\'s that bad.

       "  'text': 'A good game, and a good first attempt for a series. I realize that positive reviews aren\\'t very helpful most of the time, so if you\\'d like to skip to the useful information, jump down to the bolded part.\\nBasically, the game is a love letter to Batman in video game form. There isn\\'t much to say that can\\'t be read on the store page. There is a lot of cleverness here, and a lot of love put into the small details and designs. The game has an exhaustive amount of Batman-themed content in it. It has quite a few great highs, with a few minor lows. I couldn\\'t find any technical faults with the game, it\\'s a solid piece.\\nThe game has a variety of gadgets that get unlocked as you progress, similar to Metroid. You end up retreading the same areas several times, but each time with a new gadget. Despite how that sounds, this works out fairly well, as the returning area has been mixed up just enough to make it a different experience. The game is divided into three alternating play styles, which revolve like a door as you play. Detective work, Stealth, and Fighting.\\nThe detective work is optional, for the most part. Occasionally, Batman will whip out some fancy visual scanner to help him track down a target, which is just a glorified path to the next objective. There are also optional puzzles to solve for bonus points and unlockable challenges. This isn\\'t extremely deep, but it never really gets in the way of the experience. The bonus challenges you unlock with the puzzles are just extra stealth and combat scenarios, which range in difficulty from somewhat difficult to punishingly hard.\\nThe stealth is probably the strongest element. Stealth segments involve eliminating batches of guards using a variety of tools. Stun a guard here, leap from the shadows onto a guard there, pull 3 guards off of a railing for instant triple K.O., etc. You get a decent amount of time to observe and plan out how you are going to take down your marks. Certain stealth areas have clever routes and patterns to utilize. It feels very much like Batman to take a thoughtful and stealthy approach.\\nThe fighting is probably the weakest point, and perhaps even a point of failure. Fighting requires building combos and chaining together hits and other abilities. As you reach a higher combo, you unlock finishers and specials, which are extremely useful at dispatching more dangerous foes. The problem is that the window for failure is pretty high, and the combat system itself doesn\\'t tutorialize you well enough for how those special abiltities and combos work. You\\'ll likely spend most of the game button mashing, while the game itself heavily punishes that behavior. The combat can be very twitch-based, and something as simple as hitting the wrong button at the wrong time can void your combo and leave you very vulnerable. Add to that, encounters can be unnecessarily large, with upwards of 16 guys in a single fight.\\nDepending on the difficulty, this can be mildly annoying to downright stupid hard to manage. I completed hard mode, and some of the fights exceeded \"Dark Souls\" levels of hard at certain points. Certain boss fights were painful to complete, as they drag on for several phases with no breaks to get your bearings.\\nIt\\'s at points like these I wish this game had taken a more \"Deus Ex\" approach to its game design. The fights are mostly unavoidable, which seems unlike Batman\\'s style. Several of the scripted fights are literally Batman walking into a trap, acknowledging that he knew it was a trap beforehand, and then fighting a dozen guys. I feel like giving us more opportunities to subvert combat encounters would have suited the game a bit better. Let combat be a punishment for failing to plan ahead or be observant.\\nAs I was playing, I thought about the target audience for this game, and I came to the conclusion that you might fall into one of 3 categories.\\nYes, then it\\'s definitely worth the purchase, it\\'s a Batman fan\\'s wet dream. The game is packed to bursting with Batman fan service. Biographies on many of Batman\\'s characters, audio logs from most of the villians, epic boss fights, etc. An all around solid experience. The challenge offered by the higher difficulties might also be appealing.\\nMaybe, though the game can be rather difficult, both in combat and stealth. If you are dedicated, I\\'m sure you could learn and improve, but it\\'ll likely be hard-going if you play on anything above easy. Expect to get your butt kicked a bit. Same rules as category A as far as Batman-lore.\\nProbably not. The main selling point is Batman. This game oozes Batman lore, and if you don\\'t care for Batman, this game will probably just end up being a boring slog. I\\'m not the biggest Batman fan myself, and some of the areas and extra touches didn\\'t really hook me. If you aren\\'t into fast combat or stealth as well, I\\'d avoid this. If you are looking for something extremely challenging, there are far more focused games out there that cater to those particular niches(stealth and combo-fighting) better than this.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Gunspell is social network/mobile kind of Puzzle-RPG. I mean there are a lot of redundant interface elements and features which originates from there and they do nothing besides standing in the way and annoying you. At least they are rebalanced to avoid annoying you as much as in the original version of the game where you had to pay real money to get rid of this nonsense. Well, at least part of them since all equipment is way too fragile. Later on you may found yourself in a situation when you need to repair something after each 5-10 enemies (equipment usually have 20-40 durability points, you have 5-6 pieces of equipment, -1 point after each battle to all equipment, have fun). The game will give you loyalty present every day as many free to play games does even though it is not free to play anymore. Additionally there are a lot of various interface issues which makes it rather frustrating to play. It's not like the interface doesn't work. It does. It just doesn't help to play or actually it standing in the way. Also, I don't understand why this game has to show a loading bar in between everything. Is it so hard to just load these 366 Mb into memory and just keep them there all the time? I can't imagine any modern PC which is not capable of handling this.\\nBattles isn't fun. Mostly due to one hit killing most of the enemies in the game. Later on you will encounter better enemies with enough HP to survive 2-5 turns and equipped with some items which deals extra damage/effects and may even kill your character if you will deliberately avoid healing yourself. Maybe. Since chain-reactions happen way too often. Most likely you will heal yourself and kill your enemy with one of them. At the same time. Your active equipment can deal some extra damage, but I came to the conclusion that it's mostly useless since base damage is the only important. Damage from 3 skulls usually a few times higher than any of your weapons is capable of dealing. Well, if you want to have some fun and make battles a bit enjoyable then try to deliberately avoid dealing damage with skull combos and use only guns for this purpose.\\nArt style reminds me pop sci-fi book covers. Flashy but if you look for more than a second you will notice how mediocre it is. Also, enemies and locations doesn't look like they belong to the worlds where you encounter them. It's especially easy to spot in icy worlds.\\nBackground music doesn't worth to be mentioned. It does exist and that's all you need to know about it.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"A 2002 super hero game.  It was near the time that I really hate EA for all the things they did to the game industry and decided to boycott the game and didn't buy it.\\nFrom what I heard from other friends this is still a quite decently made game that drags long long time.\\nDespite the bad impression I got so many years ago I finnaly decided to give it a try since it's a squad based RTS with all the different unit powers.\\nYes.. it does drag on a long long time and I am finnaly near the end of it. The game itself was the way before all the super hero movies and strange heros that not native to DC or Marvel universe didn't get much recognition.\\nObjectively this game have fun old school comic graphics with old sound effect in text box trick to attract hardcore hero comic fans. All the different super powers from strength, regen, ranged blast, psi control are all in the game with nicely planned balance. Music is also very comic like and pretty fitting for the game.\\nThe game difficulty is quite hard and you can fail some objects easily and have to save and load offen. For most level I had to try 2-3 times to learn all the surprises before I can do it perfectly.\\nThere are also many many levels of this game and the story develops quite linear and semi interesting. It does feel like plots that you seen or read before from other comics if you are a hardcore fan of comic. For new fans of heroic games its just not all that suprising either.\\nOverall  it's just quite so..so.. game that will provide some entertainment though the not too aged graphics and cheessy fun.\\n6.0/10 for a bare minimum recommendation. IF you have something else to play.. don't try this as it will take long and just so so...\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Goliath is an interesting game about being stranded away from home after a plane crash. In order to compete in the environments that are increasingly foreign and dangerous, in your search for a way home, you build automatons called Goliaths. Mechanoid constructs you ride around in and perform combat in. It features open concept mini-worlds where you can gather resources, help indigenous races, and generally do their bidding. All in the search of information that most claim to have, but are unwilling to just give away, expecially to someone with the skills to do them a favor, or two.\\nThe game itself has some rough spots with polish. Not everything seems to be 100% hammered out, but the communication by the devs on the forums and responding & fixing bugs is superb and they are hammering though bugs rapidly. None of the issues I encountered were blockers, most were errors in dialog, statements out of order, certain experients to unlock new parts not being 100% clear, and generally just a feeling of not having the time/budget to do 100% of the bug testing. So I'm assuming they decided to do the last 10% with the cuminity. But none of these are anything I'd hold against the game, let alone use as justification to not get the game. It has a certain charm to it, and I find myself enjoying going through the content, trying to unlock new Goliath parts, laughing at some of the dialog, and generally just having fun.\\nIf you do get the game and encounter any issues, I'd encourage you to let the dev's known on the forums so they can iron them out. I'd hate for anyone to miss out on what is an enjoying game because of poor feedback due to bugs that can be fixed.\",\n",
